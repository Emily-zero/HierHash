9,49,"The Chemical Workers' Union was a trade union in the Czechoslovakia. The union was led by Josef Hais. The union published Dělnik ('Worker'). As of 1921, the Chemical Workers' Union had a membership of 76,978. The Chemical Workers' Union was affiliated with the Odborové sdružení československé (OSČ). However, within OSČ the Chemical Workers' Union represented a leftist position. Hais upled the line of 'non-compromising socialism'. Overall, the chemical industry workers were amongst the lowest paid workers in Czechoslovakia at the time, a fact that contributed to the radicalization of their union. The OSČ rightwing branded Hais as a 'communist', and in February 1921 a rightist splinter union was formed under the leadership of Karel Piták. In June 1922, communist trade unionists were expelled from the Metalworkers' Union (a union which was firmly controlled by Social Democrats). They then formed the 'Opposition Committee of Metalworkers'. The Opposition Committee was provisionally accepted into the Chemical Workers' Union. On 25 June 1922, a conference of revolutionary trade unionists was held in Brno. The conference staked out plans for a new trade union centre. At the conference an 'Agitation Committee for the Red International of Labour Unions' was formed, with Josef Hais as its secretary. In July 1922 the board of the Chemical Workers' Union decided that the union would join the new trade union centre once it was formed. On 13 July 1922, the Chemical Workers' Union was expelled from OSČ. When the new, pro-communist trade union centre Mezinárodní všeodborový svaz (MVS) was formed in October 1922, the Chemical Workers' Union merged into it as its Chemical workers' section. At the time of the merger, 45,068 workers of the Chemical Workers' Union joined MVS."

Christian metal is typically performed by professed Christians sometimes principally for Christians who listen to heavy metal music and often produced and distributed through various Christian networks. Christian metal bands exist in most of the subgenres of heavy metal music, and the only common link among most Christian metal bands are the lyrics. The Christian themes are often melded with the subjects of the genre the band is rooted in, regularly providing a Christian take on the subject matter. It has been argued that the marginal yet transnational Christian metal subculture provides its core members an alternative religious expression and Christian identity, and that the music serves the purpose of offering a positive message through lyrical content. This may not necessarily show a direct connection or reference to the Christian faith but often it does. Christian metal emerged in the late 1970s as a means of evangelization to the wider heavy metal music scene and was pioneered by the American Resurrection Band and Barnabas, the Swedish Jerusalem, and Canadian Daniel Band. Los Angeles' Stryper achieved wide success in the 1980s. In the mid to late 1980s, extreme metal genres were popularized by bands such as Vengeance Rising, Deliverance, Believer and Tourniquet. In the early 1990, the Australian death metal band Mortification rose to prominence within its country's underground metal scene. At the turn of the 21st century, the nu metal band P.O.D, with two platinum-selling albums, achieved a mainstream commercial success rivaling that of Stryper. The metalcore groups Underoath, Demon Hunter, As I Lay Dying and Norma Jean (dubbed by Revolver Magazine as \""The Holy Alliance\"") also brought some mainstream attention to the movement in the first decade of the 2000s, achieving ranks in the Billboard 200."

7,39,"15017 Cuppy, provisional designation 1998 SS25, is a small asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, roughly 2 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by the U.S. Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search (LONEOS) at its Anderson Mesa Station, Arizona, on 22 September 1998. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.0–2.7 AU once every 3 years and 7 months (1,296 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.16 and an inclination of 6° with respect to the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at Palomar Observatory in 1991, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 7 years prior to its discovery. As of 2016, its effective size, composition and albedo, as well as its rotation period and shape remain unknown. Based on an absolute magnitude of 15.6, the asteroid is calculated to measure between 2 and 5 kilometers in diameter, assuming an albedo in the range of 0.05 to 0.25. Since asteroids in the inner main-belt are often of a silicaceous rather than of a carbonaceous composition, with higher albedos, typically around 0.20, the asteroid's diameter might be on the lower end of NASA's published conversion table, as the higher the body's reflectivity (albedo), the smaller its diameter, for a given absolute magnitude (brightness). In September 2003, the minor planet was named in memory of American literary critic and humorist, Will Cuppy (1884–1949). He is known for his satirical books The Decline and Fall of Practically Everybody, How to Attract the Wombat, How to Become Extinct and How to Tell Your Friends from the Apes. The name was proposed by M. Walter. Naming citation was published on 10 September 2003 (M.P.C. 49675)."

Forty-one ships departed Halifax, Nova Scotia on 30 January 1941, eastbound to Liverpool, England. The use of convoys was a standard tactic throughout the Battle of the Atlantic as a defence against U-boats and German commerce raiders. On 8 February 1941 the two German battleships, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, appeared over the horizon. The German squadron was under the command of Admiral Günther Lütjens. The captain of Scharnhorst offered to draw off the escorting Royal Navy battleship HMS Ramillies, so that Gneisenau could sink the merchant ships. This strategy, if successful, would have entailed little risk to Scharnhorst as she was 11 knots (20 km/h; 13 mph) faster than Ramillies, and her newer 11-inch (279 mm) guns outranged the 1915 era 15-inch (381 mm) guns of the British ship. However, Lutjens strictly followed Hitler's directive not to engage enemy capital ships, and withdrew. Later, two of the convoy's merchant ships were sunk by the submarine U-96, including MV Arthur F. Corwin loaded with 14,500 tons of aviation spirit.

9,34,"Joseph John Holmes (24 May 1866 – 25 April 1942) was an Australian politician who served in both houses of the Parliament of Western Australia. A minister in both governments of George Leake, he was a member of the Legislative Assembly from 1897 to 1904 and again from 1905 to 1906, and later a member of the Legislative Council from 1914 until his death. Holmes was born in Mandurah, Western Australia, to Maria (née Wilson) and Robert Holmes. After leaving school, he worked in Mandurah for a time, and then went to Fremantle, where he founded a meat processing firm with his three brothers. The firm, Holmes Brothers, later expanded to Perth and to the Eastern Goldfields (during the gold rushes of the 1890s), generating large profits. Holmes was elected to the Fremantle Municipal Council in 1893, and served until 1898. At the 1897 general election, Holmes won the newly created seat of East Fremantle, defeating Matthew Moss by just six votes. He was re-elected at the 1901 election, and subsequently appointed to the ministry formed by the new premier, George Leake, as Commissioner for Railways. The Leake government fell in November 1901, and Holmes was not retained as a minister under Alf Morgans. However, Leake returned as premier a month later, and made Holmes a minister without portfolio, a position which he held until Leake's death in June 1902. At the 1904 state election, Holmes was defeated in East Fremantle by a Labor candidate, William Angwin. He reclaimed his seat at the 1905 election, winning by only 20 votes. However, that result was overturned by the Supreme Court of Western Australia in April 1906, due to issues of voter fraud. Holmes attempted to appeal this decision to the High Court of Australia, but was unsuccessful. Owing to the legal proceedings, the necessary by-election (which Holmes did not contest) was not held until November 1906. After leaving parliament, Holmes concentrated on his business interests for several years. He was elected unopposed as Mayor of Fremantle in November 1910, but resigned exactly one week after being sworn in, stating he had been misled about the state of the town finances. Holmes re-entered parliament in 1914, winning a Legislative Council by-election for North Province (caused by the death of Richard Pennefather). Standing as an independent, he was re-elected in 1914, 1920, 1926, 1932, and 1938, on each occasion unopposed. Holmes died in Perth in April 1942, aged 75, and was buried at Karrakatta Cemetery.

In order to improve the financial position of the court he introduced new taxes and reimposed duties on British traders. The Britons present in Aceh asked for exemption which was refused. British ships then blockaded the port and fired on villages situated at the estuary of the Aceh River. Meanwhile the orang kayas (grandees) and uleëbalangs (chiefs) were dissatisfied with the new levies imposed on the land. Taking advantage of the beleaguered situation of Perkasa Alam they launched a revolt. A son of his predecessor, Alauddin, secured his deposition in June 1703. Two months later he ascended the throne under the title Jamal ul-Alam Badr ul-Munir. Perkasa Alam later stayed in the village Pasanga on the east coast of Aceh.

7,39,"Pandora (/pænˈdɔərə/ pan-DOHR-ə; Greek: Πανδώρα) is an inner satellite of Saturn. It was discovered in 1980 from photos taken by the Voyager 1 probe, and was provisionally designated S/1980 S 26. In late 1985 it was officially named after Pandora from Greek mythology. It is also designated as Saturn XVII. Pandora was thought to be an outer shepherd satellite of the F Ring. However, recent studies indicate that it does not play such a role, and that only Prometheus, the inner shepherd, contributes to the confinement of the narrow ring. It is more heavily cratered than nearby Prometheus, and has at least two large craters 30 kilometres (19 mi) in diameter. The majority of craters on Pandora are shallow as a result of being filled with debris. Ridges and grooves are also present on moon's surface. The orbit of Pandora appears to be chaotic, as a consequence of a series of four 118:121 mean-motion resonances with Prometheus. The most appreciable changes in their orbits occur approximately every 6.2 years, when the periapsis of Pandora lines up with the apoapsis of Prometheus and the moons approach to within about 1,400 kilometres (870 mi). Pandora also has a 3:2 mean-motion resonance with Mimas. From its very low density and relatively high albedo, it seems likely that Pandora is a very porous icy body. There is a lot of uncertainty in these values, however, so this remains to be confirmed."

The Palanok Castle is delicately preserved, and is located on a former 68 metre high volcanic hill. The castle complex consists of three parts: the high, middle, and low castle. The founding cornerstone for the castle was laid sometime in the 14th century by the members of the Hungarian noble family Aba and was an important fortification of the Kingdom of Hungary throughout the centuries. The castle was later transformed into an impregnable fortress by French engineers. After the storming of the Bastille, a famous French prison, the Palanok Castle was used as an all-European political prison. Through the centuries, the castle served as a residence to many people: the Koriatovych family for almost 200 years, the Serbian prince Đurađ Branković, Regent of Hungary János Hunyadi, and the wife of a Hungarian king, Laiosh Maria, among many others. During the ownership of Prince Fedir Koriatovych, the castle became one of the most protected castles in the region. The prince and his family lived in the highest part of the castle, which had lavishly decorated interiors. Francis II Rákóczi later used the castle as the centre of a war of independence led by himself. In 1726, Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, granted Palanok Castle with Mukacheve, Chynadiyovo and 200 villages to Elector Lothar Franz von Schönborn who had elected and crowned him and was one of his main political supporters within the Empire. The estate, one of the largest in Eastern Europe, remained in the family well into the 20th century. From 1796 to 1897, Palanok Castle was used as a prison. During 1805–1806, the Crown of St. Stephen was kept within the castle to protect it from Napoleon I's troops. In 1926, the castle was used as a barracks, and later as an agricultural college. At the time of the castle's height, it had a strong protection: 164 cannons of varying sizes and 60 barrels of gunpowder. The castle was also surrounded by a deep moat, surrounded by high wooden walls, to protect the castle from invaders. The total area of the castle is 14,000 m².

The leaves are needle-like, 2–5 centimetres long, slender (under 1 cm wide). The needles are deciduous, turning yellow and falling singly in the late autumn, leaving the trees leafless through the winter. The female cones of larches cones are erect, small, 1–9 cm long, green or purple, ripening brown 5–8 months after pollination; in about half the species the bract scales are long and visible, and in the others, short and hidden between the seed scales.

7,51,"Hickinbotham Oval (originally Noarlunga Oval) is an Australian rules football oval in Noarlunga Downs, a southern suburb of Adelaide. It has been the home of South Australian National Football League (SANFL) club South Adelaide Football Club (\""The Panthers\"") since 1995. After previously spending 111 years (in two stints, 1882-1903 and 1904-1994) playing their home games at the Adelaide Oval which is ironically located on the northern side of the Adelaide city centre and the Torrens River, the Panthers decided to move to the southern suburb of Noarlunga in the early 1990s. The club had played two games at the Bice Oval in Christies Beach (approximately 1.5 km from Hickinbotham) in 1992 and 1993 in order to gauge support in the area for the Panthers. The 1993 game saw some 8,000 fans crammed into the oval to see the Panthers take on local rivals Glenelg. That overwhelming community support was one of the determining factors in South Adelaide's decision to permanently move to Noarlunga, becoming a community based club for the first time in its then 119-year history. The Panthers clubrooms and administration offices, which had previously been located on South Road at St Marys (directly opposite the Mitsubishi Motors factory at Tonsley Park), were also relocated to the Noarlunga Oval."

5,24,"Barbershop vocal harmony, as codified during the barbershop revival era (1930s–present), is a style of a cappella close harmony, or unaccompanied vocal music, characterized by consonant four-part chords for every melody note in a predominantly homophonic texture. Each of the four parts has its own role: generally, the lead sings the melody, the tenor harmonizes above the melody, the bass sings the lowest harmonizing notes, and the baritone completes the chord, usually below the lead. The melody is not usually sung by the tenor or baritone, except for an infrequent note or two to avoid awkward voice leading, in tags or codas, or when some appropriate embellishment can be created. Occasional passages may be sung by fewer than four voice parts. Barbershop music is generally performed by either a barbershop quartet, a group of four singers with one on each vocal part, or a barbershop chorus, which closely resembles a choir with the notable exception of the genre of music. Female barbershop quartets are sometimes referred to as Sweet Adelines quartets, in association with the organization of that name. According to the Barbershop Harmony Society (BHS), \""Barbershop music features songs with understandable lyrics and easily singable melodies, whose tones clearly define a tonal center and imply major and minor chords and barbershop (dominant and secondary dominant) seventh chords that resolve primarily around the circle of fifths, while making frequent use of other resolutions.\"" Slower barbershop songs, especially ballads, often eschew a continuous beat, and notes are often held (or sped up) ad libitum. Except for the bass, the voice parts in barbershop singing do not correspond closely to their classical music counterparts; the tenor range and tessitura are similar to those of the classical countertenor, the baritone resembles the Heldentenor or lyric baritone in range and a tenor in tessitura, and the lead generally corresponds to the tenor of classical repertoire, with some singers possessing a tessitura more similar to that of a high baritone. Barbershop singing is performed both by men's and women's groups; the elements of the barbershop style and the names of the voice parts are the same for both."

During her sporting career, she swam and trained for the MLC School's swimming club, also known as MLC Marlins, under an Australian-based coach John Bladon. Aung competed only in the women's 50 m freestyle at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. She received a ticket from FINA, under a Universality program, without meeting an entry time.

The species was described from three wing seed specimens found at localities 14051a and 14083 in the Bear Den member of the Golden Valley Formation with associated needles from the Heart River Bluffs area, site 14051a, provisionally assigned to the species also. The Bear Den member outcrops at a number of sites in western North Dakota, and is designated the type locality. The holotype specimen, number PU 20091, is preserved in the Princeton University collections, and paratype specimens are in the National Museum of Natural History collections of the Smithsonian Institution. The specimens were studied by paleobotanist Leo J. Hickey of the Yale University Geology Department. Dr Hickey published the 1977 type description for P. peregrinus in the Geological Society of America memoir 150, Stratigraphy and Paleobotany of the Golden Valley Formation (Early Tertiary) of Western North Dakota. Dr Hickey chose the specific name peregrinus, which is Latin meaning \""stranger\"" or \""newcomer\"" noting the species to be the first megafossil record for the pine family to be described from Rocky Mountains and Great Plains Paleocene rocks. The winged seeds of Pinus peregrinus are between 20 and 23 millimetres (0.79 and 0.91 in) long and have a nutlet located in the base of the wing to one side of the wing axis. The small, 4 to 5 millimetres (0.16 to 0.20 in) long nutlet is three sided and generally deltoid to ovoid in shape. The wing possesses a thickened inside margin that is straight, while the thin outside margin arches from nutlet to distal tip of the wing. The wing membrane is slightly striated parallel to the wing margins and curving towards the outside margin near the tip. This combination of characters is specific to the genus Pinus, and the seeds are most similar to the modern Pinus resinosa and Pinus tropicalis. The needles provisionally included in P. peregrinus can reach up to 10 centimetres (3.9 in) long with a distinct midrib."

Each conference team consists of 12 players, making it 24 in total. It is the featured event of NBA All-Star Weekend. NBA All-Star Weekend is a three-day event which goes from Friday to Sunday. The All-Star game was first staged at the Boston Garden on March 2, 1951. The starting lineup for each squad is selected by a fan ballot, while the reserves are chosen by a vote among the head coaches from each squad's respective conference. Coaches are not allowed to vote for their own players. If a selected player is injured and cannot participate, the NBA commissioner selects a replacement. The head coach of the team with the best record in each conference is chosen to lead their respective conference in the All-Star Game, with a prohibition against repeat appearances. Known as the \""Riley Rule\"", it was created after perennially successful Los Angeles Lakers head coach Pat Riley earned the right to coach the Western Conference team eight times in nine seasons between 1982 and 1990.

One of the great reforming popes, he is perhaps best known for the part he played in the Investiture Controversy, his dispute with Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor that affirmed the primacy of papal authority and the new canon law governing the election of the pope by the College of Cardinals. He was also at the forefront of developments in the relationship between the emperor and the papacy during the years before he became pope. He was the first pope in several centuries to rigorously enforce the Western Church's ancient policy of celibacy for the clergy and attacked the practice of simony. He excommunicated Henry IV three times. Consequently, Henry IV would appoint Antipope Clement III to oppose him in the political power struggles between the Catholic Church and his empire. Hailed as one of the greatest of the Roman pontiffs after his reforms proved successful, Gregory VII was, during his own reign, despised by some for his expansive use of papal powers. The Pope having been such a prominent champion of papal supremacy, his memory was evoked on many occasions in later generations, both positively and negatively, often reflecting later writers' attitude to the Catholic Church and the papacy. Beno of Santi Martino e Silvestro, who opposed Gregory VII in the Investiture Controversy, leveled against him charges such as necromancy, torture of a former friend upon a bed of nails, commissioning an attempted assassination, executions without trials, unjust excommunication, doubting the Real Presence of the Eucharist, and even burning the Eucharist. This was eagerly repeated by later opponents of the Catholic Church, such as the English Protestant John Foxe. Joseph McCabe describes Gregory as a \""rough and violent peasant, enlisting his brute strength in the service of the monastic ideal which he embraced.\"" In contrast, the noted historian of the 11th century H.E.J. Cowdrey writes, \""[Gregory VII] was surprisingly flexible, feeling his way and therefore perplexing both rigorous collaborators ... and cautious and steady-minded ones ... His zeal, moral force, and religious conviction, however, ensured that he should retain to a remarkable degree the loyalty and service of a wide variety of men and women.\"""

7,39,"1633 Chimay, provisional designation 1929 EC, is a dark Themistian asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt, about 36 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Belgian astronomer Sylvain Arend at the Royal Observatory of Belgium in Uccle, on 3 March 1929. Five nights later, the body was independently discovered by Max Wolf at Heidelberg Observatory in southern Germany. The asteroid is a member of the Themis family, a dynamical family of outer-belt asteroids with nearly coplanar ecliptical orbits. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.8–3.6 AU once every 5 years and 9 months (2,085 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.12 and inclination of 3° with respect to the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at Heidelberg Observatory in 1917, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 12 years prior to its discovery. Several photometric light-curve analysis rendered a well-defined, concurring rotation period of 6.6 hours (U=3/3-/2). According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures between 36.1 and 37.7 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has a low albedo between 0.079 and 0.089. In accordance with the space-based surveys, the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) derives an albedo of 0.078, and calculates a diameter of 36.1 kilometers. CALL also classifies the body as a S-type rather than a carbonaceous C-type asteroid. The minor planet was named after the Belgian town Chimay, home of the discoverer, who also co-discovered Comet Arend–Roland. Naming citation was published before November 1977 (M.P.C. 3931)."

8,57,"Riccardoella limacum or the white snail mite is a member of the Acari (mite) family which is parasitic primarily on snails. Slug mites are very small (less than 0.5 mm in length), white, and can be seen to move very rapidly over the surface of their host, particularly under the shell rim and near the pulmonary aperture. While once thought to be benign mucophages, more recent studies have shown that they actually subsist on the host's blood, and may bore into the host's body to feed. Studies have shown that this species name has been frequently misapplied to the more widespread Riccardoella oudemansi, the white slug mite. Despite its name, R. limacum is typically a restricted parasite of snails, while R. oudemansi is the common species on slugs, although it occasionally feeds on snails too."

9,40,"Great River School (GRS) is a Montessori charter school in Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States. It functions as a primary school, junior high and a high school. It is known for being community-oriented, and creating confident, kind leaders. Founded in 2004 on leadership, service, and peace formation, Great River fosters independence, critical thinking, respect, responsibility to self, to others, and to the earth. It has been recognized as one of the best high schools in Minnesota. The school has a very strong, academically rigorous program. Because it is a public school, entrance is by lottery if there are more students who want to enroll than there are spots. Typically, the enrollment period is over on the first Monday of February with the lottery the next day. Since 2007 there has been a waiting list to get into Great River, simply because so many people want to attend. On a regular basis, both the Junior and Senior High students meet in their respective groups in a community meeting to discuss various topics that impact the whole community. The elected student leaders lead this meeting, and the school talks about \""important\"" issues. One unique example of how Montessori is being applied to a high school is the way in which the High School Student Government was set up in the fall of 2005. During the fall trip, a group of students that showed an interest in student government met and brainstormed ideas about how the system should be set up for the future. After long discussions, the end result was a student-written constitution detailing the jobs and responsibilities of the cabinet and the senate. Students created a new government with twenty students, ten Advocates and ten Intermediaries. The Advocates work with the students to write bills and get things done. The Intermediaries work with the staff on programs and upcoming events throughout the school. In the first two years of the new student government, the off campus lunch bill and wireless policy were passed. This new Student Government is still going strong today."

7,9,"Interstate 80 (I-80) is a major Interstate Highway in the United States, running from the New York City Metropolitan Area westward to San Francisco, California. The New Jersey Department of Transportation also identifies I-80 as the Christopher Columbus Highway. I-80 in New Jersey runs 68.54 miles (110.30 km) from the Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge over the Delaware River at the Delaware Water Gap to its eastern terminus at I-95 in Teaneck, Bergen County. I-95 continues from the end of I-80 to the George Washington Bridge for access to New York City; access is also provided via the I-280 spur towards the Holland Tunnel and US 46 to Route 3, or I-95, towards the Lincoln Tunnel. Throughout New Jersey, I-80 runs parallel to US 46. The highway heads through rural areas of Warren and Sussex counties before heading into more suburban surroundings in Morris County. As the road continues into Passaic and Bergen counties, it heads into more urban areas. A freeway along the I-80 corridor had been planned in 1936 and again in 1955 to provide relief along US 46 between the George Washington Bridge and the Delaware Water Gap. With the establishment of the Interstate Highway System, this planned freeway, which had been identified in some planning documents as the Bergen-Passaic Expressway, would be incorporated into I-80. The freeway was built across New Jersey in various stages from the 1960s to 1973. The westernmost four miles in New Jersey was originally a rerouting of US 611 when built; that route was later realigned back into Pennsylvania. In the 1990s, high-occupancy vehicle lanes had existed on a part of I-80 in Morris County but were opened to regular traffic due to underuse.

They rebounded with their first win of the season over Tulane and followed that with a 17–16 win over Ole Miss in a game in which Alabama had to rally from a nine-point fourth quarter deficit for the victory. The next week, the Crimson Tide defeated Vanderbilt in Nashville before they returned home for their rivalry game against Tennessee. Against the Volunteers, the score was deadlocked 7–7 in the closing seconds, but Alabama had driven to the Tennessee four-yard line. Ken Stabler believing that it was third down, threw the ball out of bounds with six seconds left to stop the clock. However, it was actually fourth down, possession went to Tennessee, and the game ended in a tie. After the tie, the Crimson Tide won five in a row over Florida State, Mississippi State, LSU, South Carolina and Auburn en route to Bryant's fourth SEC title at Alabama. Because the Associated Press was holding its vote until after the bowl games instead of before for the first time, No. 4 Alabama still had a chance to win the national championship when they played No. 3 Nebraska in the Orange Bowl. On New Year's Day, No. 1 Michigan State lost in the Rose Bowl and No. 2 Arkansas lost in the Cotton Bowl Classic, and Alabama defeated Nebraska 39–28 in the Orange Bowl and captured its third AP National Championship in five years."

For the Broadway production, English lyrics were provided by Peter Reeves, with additional lyrics by Sheldon Harnick. Produced by Joop van den Ende, the original Dutch production Cyrano de Musical premiered in 1992 at the Stadsschouwburg (City Theatre) in Amsterdam. It is based on Edmond Rostand's classic 1897 play of the same name focusing on a love triangle involving the large-nosed poetic Cyrano de Bergerac, his beautiful cousin Roxane, and his classically handsome but inarticulate friend Christian de Neuvillette who, unaware of Cyrano's unrequited passion for Roxane, imposes upon him to provide the romantic words he can use to woo her successfully in mid-17th century Paris. Its style is closer to that of Les Misérables and The Phantom of the Opera than a traditional Broadway book musical. After 38 previews, the Broadway production, directed by Eddy Habbema, opened on November 21, 1993 at the Neil Simon Theatre, where it ran for 137 performances.

8,57,"The chambered nautilus, Nautilus pompilius also called the pearly nautilus, is the best-known species of nautilus. The shell, when cut away, reveals a lining of lustrous nacre and displays a nearly perfect equiangular spiral, although it is not a golden spiral. The shell exhibits countershading, being light on the bottom and dark on top. This is to help avoid predators, because when seen from above, it blends in with the darkness of the sea, and when seen from below, it blends in with the light coming from above. The eyes of the chambered nautilus, like those of all Nautilus species, are more primitive than those of most other cephalopods; the eye has no lens and thus is comparable to a pinhole camera. The species has about 90 tentacles with no suckers, which is also different from other cephalopods. Chambered nautiluses, again like all members of the genus, have a pair of rhinophores located near each eye which detect chemicals, and use olfaction and chemotaxis to find their food. The oldest fossils of the species are known from Early Pleistocene sediments deposited off the coast of Luzon in the Philippines. In 2011, scientists became alarmed at declining populations of nautilus resulting from overfishing, and have been studying world populations to determine the need for protection under the United Nations Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. As of the 3rd of Oct, 2016 at 8:15 pm during CITES Cop17 in Africa, all Nautilids were adopted into Appendix 2. Offering them higher protection from massive trade demand."

9,49,"The 29th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry was an infantry regiment in the Union army of the United States during the American Civil War. The regiment was organized in December 1861 when three new companies were attached to a battalion of seven Massachusetts companies that had been in active service since May 1861. These seven companies had been recruited to fill out the 3rd Massachusetts and 4th Massachusetts regiments and had signed on for three years of service. When the 3rd and 4th Massachusetts were mustered out in July 1861, the seven companies that had signed on for three years were grouped together to form a battalion known as the Massachusetts Battalion. Finally, in December 1861, three more companies were added to their roster to form a full regiment and the unit was designated the 29th Massachusetts. The regiment took part in 29 battles and four sieges in a variety of theaters of the war. After their early service at Fortress Monroe in Virginia, the 29th was attached, in the spring of 1862, to the Army of the Potomac during the Peninsular Campaign as part of the famed Irish Brigade. The 29th had the distinction of being the only regiment of non-Irish ethnicity to serve in that brigade. In January 1863, the IX Corps (including the 29th Massachusetts) was transferred to Kentucky and engaged in operations against Confederate guerillas. In the summer of 1863, the IX Corps was again transferred and took part in the Siege of Vicksburg and the Siege of Jackson, Mississippi. In the fall of 1863, IX Corps took part in the Knoxville Campaign which resulted in the defeat of Confederate forces in eastern Tennessee. The spring of 1864 saw the IX Corps and the 29th Massachusetts once again returned to duty with the Army of the Potomac, just in time to take part in the Overland Campaign and the Siege of Petersburg. During the Siege of Petersburg, the unit suffered their worst casualties of the war in the Battle of Fort Stedman on March 25, 1865. The 29th was mustered out of service on August 11, 1865. Including the seven months served by most of the regiment before its designation as the 29th, the unit had one of the longest terms of service of any Massachusetts regiment—a total of four years and three months."

1,26,"The women's 4 × 200 metre freestyle relay event at the 2008 Olympic Games took place on 13–14 August at the Beijing National Aquatics Center in Beijing, China. For the first time since the event's inception in 1996, the Aussies smashed a new world record to overhaul the undefeated Americans for an Olympic title with a benefit of a sterling opening leg from Stephanie Rice. Starting the program's longest relay race with a remarkable Oceanian-record split of 1:56.60, Rice and her teammates Bronte Barratt (1:56.58), Kylie Palmer (1:55.22), and Linda Mackenzie (1:55.91) registered a gold-medal time of 7:44.31 to shave nearly six seconds off the previous world record set by their greatest rivals in 2007. China's Pang Jiaying expanded her stretch over U.S. swimmer Katie Hoff with an anchor of 1:54.39 to deliver the foursome of Yang Yu (1:56.79), Zhu Qianwei (1:56.64), and Tan Miao (1:58.11) a superb Asian record time of 7:45.93, and a silver medal for the host nation. After a disappointing Olympic campaign, the U.S. team of Allison Schmitt (1:57.71), Natalie Coughlin (1:57.19), Caroline Burckle (1:56.70), and Hoff (1:54.73) finally found the best form on the blazing anchor leg to end the race for the bronze in 7:46.33, finishing nearly four seconds under the old world record. Italy's Renata Spagnolo (1:58.31), Alessia Filippi (1:56.68), Flavia Zoccari (1:59.80), and Federica Pellegrini (1:54.97) missed out the podium by over three seconds with a fourth-place time and a European record of 7:49.76. Meanwhile, the French quartet of Coralie Balmy (1:56.57), Ophélie-Cyrielle Étienne (1:57.95), Aurore Mongel (1:58.62), and Camille Muffat (1:57.52) occupied the fifth spot in 7:50.66.

8,57,"The pyjama shark or striped catshark (Poroderma africanum) is a species of catshark, and part of the family Scyliorhinidae, endemic to the coastal waters of South Africa. This abundant, bottom-dwelling species can be found from the intertidal zone to a depth of around 100 m (330 ft), particularly over rocky reefs and kelp beds. With a series of thick, parallel, dark stripes running along its stout body, the pyjama shark has an unmistakable appearance. It is additionally characterized by a short head and snout with a pair of slender barbels that do not reach the mouth, and two dorsal fins that are placed far back on the body. It can grow up to a length of 1.1 m (3.6 ft) long. The pyjama shark is primarily nocturnal, spending most of the day lying motionless and hidden in a cave or crevice or among vegetation. It often forms groups, particularly during summer. This species is an opportunistic predator that feeds on a wide variety of fishes and invertebrates; it favors cephalopods and frequents the spawning grounds of the chokka squid (Loligo reynaudi). When threatened, it curls into a circle with its tail covering its head. Reproduction is oviparous, with females laying rectangular, dark brown egg cases two at a time year-round. This small and harmless shark adapts well to captivity and is commonly displayed in public aquariums. It is often caught as a bycatch of commercial and recreational fisheries. Many are killed by fishers who regard them as pests. Although there are no data suggesting its numbers have declined, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the pyjama shark as Near Threatened because of expanding small shark fishery activities within its limited range."
7,12,"Dysart Castle is a castle ruins and property just outside Thomastown in County Kilkenny, Ireland. It is best known as the childhood home of George Berkeley, the Irish philosopher for whom Berkeley, California and the Trinity College Dublin Berkeley Library is named. The property is currently privately owned and the castle in urgent need of restoration. Located south of Thomastown, the site has held a medieval church, the castle, and other buildings. The castle and church property are situated low along the sharp curve of the River Nore. The church was originally adjoined to the castle but the properties were eventually separated by 21 ft. Dysart Castle was small and considered \""rudely built,\"" divided by a stone arch, with an access path in the second storey leading into the church. Dysart's lands and structures were granted to the Priory of Kells by founder Geoffrey fitz Robert in 1193. The charter suggests that it was known as Dysart of St. Mo-Colm-óg, or Colman, meaning St. Colman was the patron of the place. The church and castle and surrounding property belonged to the Priory of Kells, until suppression in 1540. Accounts conflict over whether Berkeley was born at Dysart Castle in 1684; he was, however, raised on the grounds of Dysart, his family home which stood beside Dysart Castle. In the 2000s, with a summary report released in 2009, archaeologist Ben Murtaugh conducted an excavation of the area with the support of fund from the Royal Irish Academy. Ruins of three stone buildings remain above ground on the property and are situated next to or close to each other; four periods of activity were identified with the site. The first period related to the Early Medieval monastic site and church, associated with St. Colman. This included a primary stone church and graveyard, a round house, two cross slabs and Romanesque architectural fragments. In the second period, the site was an out farm or grange of the Augustinian Priory of Kells (c. 1200–1540). This included an extension to the church, the construction of a tower house and the later phases of the graveyard. The third period involved the post-medieval redevelopment of the site, following the abandonment of the graveyard for burials and the church for worship. The church appeared to have been converted into an outhouse or barn. Furthermore, a long dwelling house was constructed to the south of the tower house. In this third period, the place was the childhood home of philosopher George Berkeley (1685–1753). Due to degradation of structures, Dysart is now considered a romantic ruin. In April 2003, The Irish Times published an urgent appeal for assistance for restoration of Dysart Castle and cited the risk of \""imminent collapse\"" following the emergence of new cracks in the walls of the castle; previously conservation work had been conducted with the aid of Kilkenny County Council acting for the Department of the Environment and private efforts."

7,23,"Montana Mountain is a deeply eroded Late Cretaceous stratovolcano located south of Carcross, Yukon, Canada. As well as its main peak, the mountain includes many sub-peaks and contains felsic pyroclastics and flows; typically altered and orange-weathering. Montana Mountain was formed when the ancient Kula Plate was subducting under southwestern Yukon during the Late Cretaceous period. A flurry of quartz mining activity took place on Montana Mountain starting in 1899, peaking in 1905-1906 when American mining promoter John Conrad consolidated claims on Montana Mountain and built three tramways to carry the ore back down, including a 4-mile-long one from Windy Arm on Tagish Lake to the Mountain Hero mine. Montana Mountain is also an important landmark for the Carcross/Tagish First Nations living in the area. According to legend, Montana Mountain is one of the peaks Game Mother used to hang a swing for her animal creations. On this swing each kind of animal danced and sang a different song. Following this \""celebration\"" Game Mother gave each animal their characteristic attributes of today. In addition to its spiritual importance, the mountain was also an important source of food, medicines, and refuge. During the early quartz mining period, an extensive network of trails were constructed on the mountain to connect the many silver claims with Carcross and/or Windy Arm. In 2005 the Carcross/Tagish First Nation took back the mountain in its land claim settlement and set out to restore some of the old trails and make them accessible for public use and enjoyment. Through a programme called \""SingleTrack to Success\"" an extensive network of mountain bike trails have been developed on the lower slopes of Montana Mountain. Additionally, these trails have been mapped and the maps are publicly available."

8,57,"Phalacrocoracidae is a family of some 40 species of aquatic birds commonly known as cormorants and shags. Several different classifications of the family have been proposed recently, and the number of genera is disputed. There is no consistent distinction between \""cormorants\"" and \""shags\"" as these appellations have been assigned to different species randomly. Cormorants and shags are medium-to-large birds, with body weight in the range of 0.35–5 kilograms (0.77–11.02 lb) and wing span of 45–100 centimetres (18–39 in). The majority of species have dark feathers. The bill is long, thin and hooked. Their feet have webbing between all four toes. All species are fish-eaters, catching the prey by diving from the surface. They are excellent divers, and under water they propel themselves with their feet with help from their wings; some cormorant species have been found to dive as deep as 45 metres. They have relatively short wings due to their need for economical movement underwater, and consequently have the highest flight costs of any bird. Cormorants nest in colonies around the shore, on trees, islets or cliffs. They are coastal rather than oceanic birds, and some have colonised inland waters – indeed, the original ancestor of cormorants seems to have been a fresh-water bird. They range around the world, except for the central Pacific islands."

9,6,"Thomas Cranmer (2 July 1489 – 21 March 1556) was a leader of the English Reformation and Archbishop of Canterbury during the reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI and, for a short time, Mary I. He helped build the case for the annulment of Henry's marriage to Catherine of Aragon, which was one of the causes of the separation of the English Church from union with the Holy See. Along with Thomas Cromwell, he supported the principle of Royal Supremacy, in which the king was considered sovereign over the Church within his realm. During Cranmer's tenure as Archbishop of Canterbury, he was responsible for establishing the first doctrinal and liturgical structures of the reformed Church of England. Under Henry's rule, Cranmer did not make many radical changes in the Church, due to power struggles between religious conservatives and reformers. However, he succeeded in publishing the first officially authorised vernacular service, the Exhortation and Litany. When Edward came to the throne, Cranmer was able to promote major reforms. He wrote and compiled the first two editions of the Book of Common Prayer, a complete liturgy for the English Church. With the assistance of several Continental reformers to whom he gave refuge, he changed doctrine in areas such as the Eucharist, clerical celibacy, the role of images in places of worship, and the veneration of saints. Cranmer promulgated the new doctrines through the Prayer Book, the Homilies and other publications. After the accession of the Roman Catholic Mary I, Cranmer was put on trial for treason and heresy. Imprisoned for over two years and under pressure from Church authorities, he made several recantations and apparently reconciled himself with the Roman Catholic Church. However, on the day of his execution, he withdrew his recantations, to die a heretic to Roman Catholics and a martyr for the principles of the English Reformation. Cranmer's death was immortalised in Foxe's Book of Martyrs and his legacy lives on within the Church of England through the Book of Common Prayer and the Thirty-Nine Articles, an Anglican statement of faith derived from his work."

7,41,"Soyuz 8 (Russian: Союз 8, Union 8) was part of a joint mission with Soyuz 6 and Soyuz 7 that saw three Soyuz spacecraft in orbit together at the same time, carrying a total of seven cosmonauts. The crew consisted of commander Vladimir Shatalov and flight engineer Aleksei Yeliseyev, whose mission was to dock with Soyuz 7 and transfer crew, as the Soyuz 4 (involving, among others, these two cosmonauts) and Soyuz 5 missions did. Soyuz 6 was to film the operation from nearby. However, this objective was not achieved due to equipment failures. Soviet sources were later to claim that no docking had been intended, but this seems unlikely, given the docking adapters carried by the spacecraft, and the fact that both Shatalov and Yeliseyev were veterans of the previous successful docking mission. This was the last time that the Soviet-crewed Moon landing hardware was tested in orbit, and the failure seems to have been one of the final nails in the coffin of the programme. The radio call sign of the spacecraft was Granit, meaning Granite. This word is apparently used as the name of a reactive or defensive squadron in Soviet military training, and, just like the Soyuz 5, it was constructed and its crew was trained to be the responsive (not entirely passive) or female spacecraft in its docking. Giving military names to the spacecraft was probably a response to an appeal that the commander of the Soyuz 5 made. Further, the word was probably chosen as it begins with a letter following that sequence starting with Antey (meaning Antaeus) and Buran (meaning Blizzard); Г (G) is the fourth letter of the Russian alphabet."

His name has been said to have occurred for the first time in a papal letter datable to 25 November 1390, but this letter is simply a repetition of another addressed to him, dated 2 August that year; both letters address him as the rector of the parish church of Kirkmahoe, and authorise him to take up the position of provost of the Collegiate Church of Lincluden providing he resigned Kirkmahoe within a period of two years. This Collegiate Church, previously a Benedictine nunnery, was erected only on 7 May 1389, after a petition of Archibald Douglas (\""the Grim\""), Lord of Galloway, to Avignon Pope Clement VII. Papal authorisation came in a letter to the Bishop of Glasgow, inside whose diocese Lincluden lay, which stated:...as is contained in the petition of Archibald, Lord of Galloway, his predecessors founded and built the monastery of Lincluden, O. CLUN., ... and endowed it for the maintenance of eight or nine nuns, to be ruled by a prioress, while right of patronage remained with the lords of Galloway ...The letter goes into the details of the monastery's problems and decline, details provided to the papacy by the Lord of Galloway, and asks Bishop Walter Wardlaw:to ascertain that these facts be true and having transferred the nuns to a house of the Cluniac or Benedictine order, to erect the collegiate church and hospice ... He still held both Lincluden and Kirkmahoe on 17 May 1391, when the Pope wrote to him providing him to a canonry and prebend of Glasgow Cathedral. Elisaeus retained his position as provost of Lincluden until 1406. In that year he was elected and received papal provision to the vacant diocese of Galloway. This election was ascribed by historian Michael Brown to the influence of the Lord of Galloway, now Archibald Douglas II. In a lost MacDowall charter, witnessed by Robert Keith and datable to 1412, he was said to have been in his seventh year of consecration. Nothing more is known about Elisaeus's career as Bishop of Galloway; the time of his death is not known either, but he died sometime before 14 June 1415, when there occurs the earliest evidence that a successor for Galloway was needed."

9,46,"Helix was a short-lived, science fiction and science fantasy imprint of DC Comics, launched in 1996 and discontinued in 1998. In early promotional materials prior to the release of the first title, the imprint was called Matrix instead of Helix. It was renamed because of the then-upcoming film, The Matrix. It featured a handful of ongoing monthly series, several limited series, and one short graphic novel. Despite the involvement of successful science fiction/fantasy novelists Michael Moorcock, Lucius Shepard and Christopher Hinz, and established comics creators Howard Chaykin, Elaine Lee, Matt Howarth, Warren Ellis, Walt Simonson, and Garth Ennis, sales of the comic books were low, and most of the ongoing titles were cancelled after 12 or fewer issues. Ellis' Transmetropolitan was switched to the Vertigo imprint, where it continued for several more years before reaching its planned conclusion. Ennis' Bloody Mary mini-series and Michael Moorcock's Multiverse were later collected in Vertigo-label paperbacks and Moeller's Sheva's War was released as a graphic novel paperback by Dark Horse. Limited availability of the books in bookstores that already sold science fiction, resistance among science-fiction readers to serialized monthly publication, the lower visibility of the line's deliberately muted cover color palette, and the lack of interest in genre SF among regular patrons of comic-book stores, were all cited by industry observers as factors in the imprint's demise."

8,57,"The Allodapini is a tribe of bees in the subfamily Xylocopinae, family Apidae. They occur throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South East Asia, and Australasia. There is also a rare genus, Exoneuridia, that occurs in isolated regions of Turkey, Iraq, Lebanon and Iran. Many of the species in the tribe form small social colonies where a group of females cooperatively care for the developing larvae. The larvae are fed on pollen which, like most other bees, is carried on specialised hairs of the hind pair of legs, but the pollen is fed to the larvae in a progressive fashion and usually placed directly onto their bodies where they then consume it. The larvae of allodapine bees are remarkable in their complex morphology, and in most species they possess appendages, tubercles and long setae. The strange morphology of allodapine larvae is probably a result of living in open tunnels where they are in constant contact with other larvae and with adults. The appendages, tubercles and setae serve to hold and manipulate food, and may also help larvae move around the nest. These abilities are important because larvae compete with each other to gain food, a situation which is different from all other bees, where individual larvae are isolated in cells and do not have to compete with each other. There are over 300 described species of allodapine bees, but many more species are undescribed. They are unique among bees in progressively rearing their larvae in undivided tunnels, so that individual larvae are not physically isolated from each other and are in constant contact with adult females, who provide them with food, groom them, and remove their faeces. Allodapine bees vary greatly in their forms of sociality, from subsocial to highly eusocial. There are no known species that are purely solitary. They have been used widely to study social evolution, sex allocation, social parasitism, and historical biogeography."

1,48,"Canboulay (from the French cannes brulées, meaning burnt cane) is a precursor to Trinidad and Tobago Carnival. The festival is also where calypso music has its roots. It was originally a harvest festival, at which drums, singing, dancing and chanting were an integral part. After Emancipation (1838), it developed into an outlet and a festival for former indentured laborers and freed slaves who were banned from participating in the masquerade carnival events – derived from European Christian traditions – of the colonial elite, and whose drums and religious observances were also outlawed in the late 19th century. Consequently, Canboulay has played an important role in the development of the music of Trinidad and Tobago, for it was the banning of percussion instruments in the 1880s that led to the surreptitious innovations that gave birth to steelpan music. It is re-enacted in Port of Spain each Carnival Friday in Trinidad."

In Japanese, the engagement was referred to as the Naval Battle off Malaya (マレー沖海戦 Marē-oki kaisen). The objective of Force Z, which consisted of one battleship, one battlecruiser and four destroyers, was to intercept the Japanese invasion fleet north of Malaya. However, the task force sailed without any air support, which had been declined by Admiral Sir Tom Phillips, the commander of Force Z, in favour of maintaining radio silence. Although the British had a close encounter with Japanese heavy surface units, the force failed to find and destroy the main convoy. On their return to Singapore they were attacked in open waters and sunk by long-range medium bombers. Along with the attack on Pearl Harbor only a few days earlier, the Malayan engagement illustrated the effectiveness of aerial attacks against even the heaviest of naval assets if they were not protected by air cover, and led the Allies to place importance on their aircraft carriers over battleships. The sinking of the two ships severely weakened the Eastern Fleet in Singapore, and the Japanese invasion fleet was only engaged by submarines until the Battle off Endau on 27 January 1942."

She is believed to be an influence for the fairy tale of Snow White. Margaretha's father owned several copper mines - a majority of workers were children. When Margaretha was about 16 or 17, she left her home because she and her new step-mother could not get along. She settled in Brussels and soon attracted the attention of the future Philip II of Spain. They became lovers with the intention to marry; however, the union was forbidden by Phillip's father (who saw no political value) and Margaretha's step-mother (who simply hated the girl). Unlike the fairy tale, this story does not have a happy ending: be it fate or foul play, Margaretha was dead by the age of 21. It is believed that she was poisoned: the handwriting in her last will and testament was shaky enough to make most people think she had developed tremors, a sign of poisoning. However, no one knows what exactly killed Margaretha, though we can rule out one suspect: her stepmother was already dead. Another of her suitors was Lamoral, Count of Egmont. Eckhard Sander, in his book Schneewittchen: Märchen oder Wahrheit? (Snow White: Is It a Fairy Tale?), alleges that Margaretha is inspiration for the tale of Snow White."

When Eines was absent in July and August because of a prison sentence, Trond Hegna was the acting editor. Members of Mot Dag, namely Hegna, Johan Vogt, Carl Viggo Lange and Sverre Kolltveit, exercised a considerable influence in the whole of Eines' editor period.

King was elected to the Louisiana State Senate from Calcasieu Parish in the southwestern part of the state and rose to president pro tempore of that body. When Huey Pierce Long, Jr., vacated the governorship for a seat in the United States Senate, King replaced him as governor for the three and a half months remaining in Long's elected term. During his brief tenure, he called for a reduction in highway spending, since the Great Depression made it difficult to finance bonds at an acceptable rate. This was also during the time of construction of the Huey P. Long Bridge in Jefferson Parish. Signs above the roadway entrance to the bridge proclaim that it was built during the administrations of Huey Long and Oscar K. Allen; no mention is made of King's tenure. King had succeeded Paul N.

9,49,"The Dominican Revolutionary Party (Spanish: Partido Revolucionario Dominicano or PRD) is one of the main political parties of the Dominican Republic. Traditionally a left of the centre position and social democratic in name, the party has shifted since the 2000s toward the centre-right. The party’s distinctive color is white. Traditionally, the party has two presidents: the \""Titular President\"" and the \""Acting President\"" (and actually, a sort of Vice-President); until 2010 the Presidents and the Secretary-General were proscribed to run for any elected office. The party was founded in 1939 by several Dominican expatriated exiles living in Havana, Cuba, led by Juan Bosch. It was then established in the Dominican Republic on July 5, 1961. It was the first Dominican party based on populist and democratic leftist principles and an organization based on mass membership. Bosch was elected president in 1962 in what is generally believed to be the first honest election in the country's history. Bosch later left the party in a dispute over its ideological direction, and founded the Dominican Liberation Party on December 16, 1973. The PRD has won the presidency three other times—in 1978 (Antonio Guzmán), 1982 (Salvador Jorge Blanco) and 2000 (Hipólito Mejía). At the legislative elections, on the 16 May 2002, the party won 41.9% of the popular vote and 73 out of 150 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 29 out of 31 seats in the Senate of the Dominican Republic. Its candidate at the presidential election on the 16th of May 2004, Hipólito Mejía, won 33.6% of the votes, failing to win a second term. In the 16 May 2006 legislative elections, the party formed together with its traditional opponent, the Social Christian Reformist Party, and others the Grand National Alliance, that won only 82 out of 178 deputies and 10 out of 32 senators. The Dominican Revolutionary Party led the alliance, however, winning about 60 seats in the chamber of deputies and 6 in the Senate. The party has been criticized for involvement in corruption, allowing right-wing paramilitary groups to operate from its soil for attacks launched into Haiti, and for becoming an increasingly conservative party serving the interests of transnational capital over the poor majority. The last PRD president, Hipólito Mejía, has been especially criticized for supporting the Iraq War."

However, it appears to be not as distinct as formerly presumed, but rather somewhat closer to such genera as Chalcides and Sepsina.

Thus, it will probably be eventually assigned to a new, yet-to-be-named subfamily. (Austin & Arnold 2006)"

Although the intent was to remain until 23 August, at 14:00 hours on 22 August the watch aboard ship alerted the captain to the presence of an armed vessel, the Spanish frigate Gerona. Captain McPherson decided to leave all his supplies on the dock and got the ship underway 90 minutes after the first sighting of Gerona. In its haste, Tornado had not been inspected by or granted permission to leave port from the Portuguese authorities in Madeira. Two blank charges were fired to signal that Tornado should stop, but Tornado continued out of port. Gerona had been sent from Cádiz under the command of captain Benito Ruiz de la Escalera specifically to capture Tornado and its sister ship, Cyclone. The firing of the charges alerted Gerona of the presence of Tornado and Gerona gave chase. At 22:30 Gerona fired a blank shot. Tornado continued to ignore the intent. Gerona followed up with three live shots; Tornado stopped its engines and struck its colors. The crew of Tornado was transferred to Gerona. Tornado was manned by a prize crew commanded by naval lieutenant Manuel de Bustillo y Pery. Tornado sailed for Cádiz, where it arrived on 26 August, while Gerona returned to Madeira in a fruitless search for Tornado's sister ship Cyclone."

7,23,"Mount Malindig (also known as Mount Malindik and Mount Marlangga) is a large potentially active stratovolcano on the island of Marinduque in the Philippines. The name Marinduque itself may have been derived from Marindik or Malindik. The tale told by the people of Buenavista, the town that sits at the foot of Malindig, is that during the Spanish times, a Spanish soldier got lost. He came upon a girl sitting down sorting rice. He asked her what was the name of this place. She replied in Tagalog matindig (translation: \""Let me stand up\"") so she could get a better view of the area. The Spaniard mistook the girl and thought the mountain was called Matindig, and unable to ennunciate Tagalog, he called it Malindig. Malindig is considered a potentially active volcano, in part because of the solfataric springs of Malbog. Its unique location, at the heart of Southern Tagalog, creates a panorama that encompasses Mindoro, Verde Island, and Southern Luzon all the way to Bicol and Burias Island. There is a military radio outpost at 900MASL. The mountain is the largest on the Island of Marinduque and the most popular climb and hike on the island for mountaineers and alike, known for its unique environmental biodiversity.

After passing the Radio Station base on the mountain, it has been known to be a mossy and closed canopy forest trek with regular foggy surroundings.

A light-hitting, defensive specialist, Isora batted a measly .128 average in her three-year career, but collected a solid .305 on-base percentage and a 1.42 walk-to-strikeout ratio (100-to-70). Isora learned her baseball skills from her father, Argelio del Castillo, a well-respected amateur shortstop in Cuba. She followed the steps of her father at shortstop, and also played efficiently at second base and third base. In 1947, at age 15, she played third base for the Habaneras, one of two women's teams that roamed Cuba playing games with each other. (Article in Spanish) The first AAGPBL spring training outside the United States was held in Cuba in 1947, as part of a plan to create an International League of Girls Baseball. The experiment took shape when Cuban executives Alfonso Rodríguez and Rafael León and AAGPBL president Max Carey formed two teams, one called the Cubans and the other called the Americans. Both teams toured Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Puerto Rico and Venezuela, playing exhibition games with each other. After that, Isora and her aforementioned fellows were contracted by the AAGPBL between 1948 and 1949. She was assigned to the Chicago Colleens development team in 1949. The next season, she gained promotion to the Kalamazoo Lassies, playing for them one and a half years before joining the Kenosha Comets during the 1951 midseason. Isora retired after marrying Raymundo Kinney. After baseball, she worked in electronics for 40 years and became a hospital volunteer. In 1988, she became part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Another tribute to the AAGPBL players came with the 1992 film A League of Their Own, featuring Tom Hanks, Geena Davis and Madonna, and directed by filmmaker Penny Marshall. In 2011, she and her AAGPBL teammates from Cuba were honored by having their names and photos presented at a ceremony in New York City. The event was presented by Leslie Heaphy, history professor at Kent State University of Ohio, during the Cuban Baseball Congress held on August 20 at Fordham University. In addition, Isora del Castillo is the only woman enshrined in the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame, having been elected in 1997. She currently lives in Hialeah, Florida."

Trained at Levin by Errol Skelton, the filly didn't show a great deal as a two-year-old but quickly proved herself as the champion three-year-old of the 1983-84 season. Travelling down to the Guineas meeting at Riccarton on the back of two impressive victories at Trentham, Our Flight was beaten by a nose in the 2000 Guineas before asserting her dominance over the fillies in the 1000 Guineas the following Saturday. Shortly after she added the Levin Classic and Eulogy Stakes. By the time she passed the post in the Derby as a narrow winner over subsequent Auckland Cup winner Secured Deposit, she had won eight of her ten races as a three-year-old and finished second in the other two. The Derby was her third Group 1 victory. After the Derby she only raced twice more, and on the first of those occasions was a close third in the New Zealand Oaks."

9,6,"Moses (/ˈmoʊzɪz, -zɪs/; Hebrew: מֹשֶׁה‎‎, Modern Moshe Tiberian Mōšéh ISO 259-3 Moše; Syriac: ܡܘܫܐ‎ Moushe; Arabic: موسى‎‎ Mūsā; Greek: Mωϋσῆς Mōÿsēs in both the Septuagint and the New Testament) is a prophet in Abrahamic religions. According to the Hebrew Bible, he was a former Egyptian prince who later in life became a religious leader and lawgiver, to whom the authorship of the Torah, or acquisition of the Torah from Heaven is traditionally attributed. Also called Moshe Rabbenu in Hebrew (מֹשֶׁה רַבֵּנוּ, lit. \""Moses our Teacher\""), he is the most important prophet in Judaism. He is also an important prophet in Christianity, Islam, Bahá'ísm as well as a number of other faiths. According to the Book of Exodus, Moses was born in a time when his people, the Israelites, an enslaved minority, were increasing in numbers and the Egyptian Pharaoh was worried that they might ally themselves with Egypt's enemies. Moses' Hebrew mother, Jochebed, secretly hid him when the Pharaoh ordered all newborn Hebrew boys to be killed in order to reduce the population of the Israelites. Through the Pharaoh's daughter (identified as Queen Bithia in the Midrash), the child was adopted as a foundling from the Nile river and grew up with the Egyptian royal family. After killing an Egyptian slavemaster (because the slavemaster was smiting a Hebrew to death), Moses fled across the Red Sea to Midian, where he encountered The Angel of the Lord, speaking to him from within a burning bush on Mount Horeb (which he regarded as the Mountain of God). God sent Moses back to Egypt to demand the release of the Israelites from slavery. Moses said that he could not speak with assurance or eloquence, so God allowed Aaron, his brother, to become his spokesperson. After the Ten Plagues, Moses led the Exodus of the Israelites out of Egypt and across the Red Sea, after which they based themselves at Mount Sinai, where Moses received the Ten Commandments. After 40 years of wandering in the desert, Moses died within sight of the Promised Land. According to archaeologist William G. Dever, scholarly consensus sees Moses as a legendary figure and not a historical person. Archaeological evidence does not support a mass-migration from Egypt, as described in the Bible. Rabbinical Judaism calculated a lifespan of Moses corresponding to 1391–1271 (120 years) BCE; Jerome gives 1592 BCE, and James Ussher 1571 BCE as his birth year."

A Topps Rookie All-Star in his inaugural season, he appeared in the 1972 World Series with Oakland. Like Gonzalo Márquez, Cullen was a valuable utility for the World Championship team providing support from the bench during the regular season. In his career, Cullen was a competent infielder with good instincts and an avid student of the game; but he couldn’t helped himself with the bat. Even when he hit in the low .200s, Cullen's glove was enough to get him a considerable playing time.

4,45,"Pushing the Senses is the fifth album by the British rock band Feeder. It was released on Echo, Liberation Music and PIAS on 31 January 2005 in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Europe, while being released on Pony Canyon in Japan on 10 February 2005. Despite mixed reviews, the album was a commercial success, in which it was a top five album in Feeder's native United Kingdom, and its lead single \""Tumble and Fall\"" was a top five single. This made the album Feeder's most successful in terms of peak chart position, but did not experience the same chart longetivity as presuccessor Comfort in Sound, which spent 36 weeks on the UK top 75 chart in comparison to the 15 weeks spent by Pushing the Senses. The album represented a similar musical style as seen on 2002's Comfort in Sound, and featured more songs written on a piano and also had, as described by frontman Grant Nicholas, more of an \""organic\"" sound than that of the latter. Inspirations were that of John Lennon within some of the songwriting. Most critics criticised the band's approach to what was described as Keane and Coldplay style music, and \""departing\"" from their trademark sound heard on their first three albums, while Q magazine stated that the album could \""finally establish Feeder as major league players\""."

9,49,"The Amalgamated Weavers' Association, often known as the Weavers' Amalgamation, was a trade union in the United Kingdom. Initially, it operated in competition with the North East Lancashire Amalgamated Weavers' Association in part of its area, and it was therefore nicknamed the Second Amalgamation. The union was founded in 1884 as the Northern Counties Amalgamated Association of Weavers, with the participation of thirty-four local trade unions: The majority of the union's members were female: in 1894, 45,000 of its 80,000 total membership were women. This was unusual; outside the cotton industry, very few women were members of trade unions. By 1937, membership had risen to 94,000, and the proportion of women had grown further, to a total of 75,000 of its members. For many years, the union campaigned against the practice of steaming in cotton mills. The union took its final name in 1923. In 1974, it merged with the National Union of Textile and Allied Workers to form the Amalgamated Textile Workers' Union. Notable leaders of the union include secretary Thomas Birtwistle and president David Shackleton."

Wyse suffered a spinal injury that kept him from serving in World War II. As a result, he wore a corset at times to pitch. A control pitcher, Wyse was a sinkerballer and a curve specialist. His most productive season came in 1945, when he helped the Chicago Cubs to win the National League pennant after going 22–10 with a 2.68 ERA.

9,47,"Chea Job Cheapoo, Sr. (born 1942) is a Liberian politician who served as the 15th Chief Justice of Liberia from July 1987 until his impeachment and removal from office on December 2 of that year. Cheapoo served in the late 1970s as a Senator from Grand Gedeh County. At that time, he also served as the head counsellor for the Progressive Alliance of Liberia (PAL), an opposition party later outlawed by President William Tolbert. In early 1980, he served as a spokesman for its successor, the Progressive People's Party (PPP). Following the overthrow of the Tolbert government in a 1980 coup, Cheapoo was appointed Attorney General in April 1980 under the People's Redemption Council regime. However, Cheapoo was removed from his position and arrested in September 1981 after being accused of stockpiling arms without permission of the PRC. Following the resignation of Chief Justice James N. Nagbe in June 1987, Cheapoo was appointed by President Samuel Doe as Chief Justice. Soon after taking office, he was accused of illegally ordering the arrest of a probate judge and his wife, Harper S. Bailey and Muna Stubblefield, whom he stated had tried to bribe him with $2,000. Amid the resulting controversy, he accused President Doe of unconstitutionally releasing the couple in question, but he submitted to President Doe his resignation on 10 November 1987, but Doe rejected it and called for him to be punished with the removal of his citizenship. Consequently, he was impeached by the House of Representatives later in the month, and the Senate convicted him and removed him from office on 2 December on charges of violating the Constitution while in office. The vote was nearly unanimous; only David Menyongai of Margibi County voted to acquit. Cheapoo was the first government official to be impeached in Liberia's history. Shortly after his deposition, he was arrested on a charge of defaming President Doe, but he received substantial popular support: he was cheered by crowds of commoners as he went to trial, and the Montserrado County bar association voted to boycott Judge Bailey's courtroom until his removal. Cheapoo later participated in the 1997 general elections as the standard bearer of a reconstituted Progressive People's Party (PPP). As the party's candidate for president, Cheapoo won only 0.34% of the vote, while the party failed to win any seats in the Legislature. The party did not field candidates in the 11 October 2005 elections, but Cheapoo was once again the party's candidate for president in 2011, winning 0.3% of the vote and no seats in the legislature."

He placed 6th at the 1968 Winter Olympics and 5th at the 1972 Winter Olympics. His best finish at the World Championships was 4th in 1972; he placed 5th in 1969, 1970, and 1971. In 1972, he won the gold medal at the World University Games. Petkevich was coached by Arthur Bourke and Gustave Lussi. He was known as a particularly dynamic free skater for his time. His emphasis on freer musical expression and less rigid body lines set him apart from most other men's singles competitors of his era. He has also been credited with innovating fashion for male competitors by wearing a more athletic costume of a jumpsuit and turtleneck sweater rather than the more formal suit-and-tie outfit that was otherwise universal in the 1960s. By the early 1970s, many other skaters had emulated Petkevich's costume style. In 1970, while a student at Harvard University, Petkevich founded An Evening with Champions, a long-running annual ice show that raises money to benefit the Jimmy Fund and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Petkevich was the recipient of an unusual trophy. At the 1947 World Figure Skating Championships, Ulrich Salchow was particularly impressed by Dick Button's skating, and gave him one of his own trophies. Following the 1972 Olympics, Button passed on Salchow's trophy to Petkevich. In 2010, Petkevich passed the trophy to Paul Wylie, keeping alive the meaning of the trophy which is meant to reward a skater for having had a material impact on the sport. Following his competitive career, Petkevich attended University of Oxford as a Rhodes scholar, earning a Ph.D. in cell biology in 1978. He subsequently studied music privately, was a Fellow in the Music Department at Harvard, and was composer-in-residence at Eliot House, Harvard. In 1983, he joined Hambrecht & Quist as a securities analyst following the biotechnology industry. From 1987 to 1989, he pursued healthcare investment banking. In 1989, he joined Robertson Stephens & Co. as Managing Director and served several roles including Head of Healthcare Banking and Head of Investment Banking. In 2008, he founded The Petkevich Group, a boutique advisory firm where he was Chairman and CEO from 1998 to 2005. In 2006, He co-founded along with Dennis McCoy, MD, BladeRock Capital, the General Partner of the V2MTM Life Sciences Fund. The Fund makes contrarian investments in undervalued public companies, which are developing medical breakthrough products that address large, unmet medical needs. Petkevich is the author of Figure Skating: Championship Techniques (ISBN 0-452-26209-7), one of the standard reference works on figure skating technique. He has also served as a figure skating analyst for NBC, CBS, and ESPN. Petkevich has also composed a Clarinet Quintet, a Piano Trio, A Sonata for Piano and a number of songs in different genre.

8,31,"Pinus palustris, commonly known as the longleaf pine, is a pine native to the southeastern United States, found along the coastal plain from eastern Texas to southeast Virginia, extending into northern and central Florida. It reaches a height of 30–35 m (98–115 ft) and a diameter of 0.7 m (28 in). In the past, they reportedly grew to 47 m (154 ft) with a diameter of 1.2 m (47 in). The bark is thick, reddish-brown, and scaly. The leaves are dark green and needle-like, and occur in bundles of three. They often are twisted and 20–45 cm (7.9–17.7 in) in length. It is one of the two southeastern U.S. pines with long needles, the other being slash pine. The cones, both female seed cones (ovulate strobili) and male pollen cones (staminate strobili), are initiated during the growing season before buds emerge. Pollen cones begin forming in their buds in July, while seed conelets are formed during a relatively short period of time in August. Pollination occurs early the following spring, with the male cones 3–8 cm (1.2–3.1 in) long. The female (seed) cones mature in about twenty months from pollination; when mature they are yellow-brown in color, 15–25 cm (5.9–9.8 in) long, and 5–7 cm (2.0–2.8 in) broad, opening to 12 cm (4.7 in), and have a small, but sharp, downward-pointing spine on the middle of each scale. The seeds are 7–9 mm (0.28–0.35 in) long, with a 25–40 mm (0.98–1.57 in) wing. Longleaf pine takes 100 to 150 years to become full size and may live to be 500 years old. When young, they grow a long taproot, which usually is 2–3 m (6.6–9.8 ft) long; by maturity they have a wide spreading lateral root system with several deep 'sinker' roots. It grows on well-drained, usually sandy soil, often in pure stands. In northern Alabama, it sometimes occurs on clay soil. The scientific name meaning, \""of marshes,\"" is a misunderstanding on the part of Philip Miller who described the species, after seeing longleaf pine forests with temporary winter flooding. Longleaf pine also is known as being one of several species grouped as a southern yellow pine or longleaf yellow pine, and in the past as pitch pine (a name dropped as it caused confusion with pitch pine, Pinus rigida)."

At the close of voting, the song had only received 8 points (from neighbours Spain) and finished in 23rd - last - place, thus forcing Andorra to qualify through the semi-final in their next Contest appearance. The song itself is a dramatic ballad, with the singer describing herself as being \""at the end of the road\"" without her lover. She sings that she has no reason to live without him, in fact. The performance of the song was somewhat criticised by fans and commentators, as Jenny was surrounded by a number of dancers wearing white lingerie and Jenny herself performed in what looked like a black nightgown. It was succeeded as Andorran representative at the 2007 Contest by Anonymous with \""Salvem el món\""."

The Gudbrandsdalslågen begins in the lake Lesjaskogsvatnet (or Lesjavatn), which lies in Lesja municipality in Oppland. Lesjavatn is the only lake in Norway which has two outlets; they flow into two of Norway’s more famous rivers. In the southeast at Lesjaverk village the lake serves as the headwaters for the Gudbrandsdalslågen, while in the northwest at Lesjaskog village, Lesjavatn is the headwaters for the Rauma river. The Gudbrandsdalslågen flows through the Gudbrandsdal. Western tributaries of the Gudbrandsdalslågen include the Gausa River flowing through the Gausdal valley, the Otta River flowing through the Ottadalen valley, the Vinstra River flowing through the Vinstradal valley, and the Sjoa River, flowing through the Heidal valley. The eastern rivers, Jora, Ula, Frya, Tromsa and Mesna are shorter and drop precipitously from the heights of the Rondane. Although relatively placid for extended stretches of its 200-kilometre (120 mi) path, the Gudbrandsdalslågen drops rapidly through the Rosten Gorge in Sel.

He signed for Portsmouth as a trainee and made his debut in 1946 against Blackburn Rovers Settling into the side quickly at either wing-half or left-half, he was part of the team that won successive league championships in 1948–49 and 1949–50. His performances earned him a call-up to the England national football team. He went on to win 48 caps for England, making him Portsmouth's most capped English player of all time. During his record 845 club appearances for Pompey and his 48 England caps he was never once booked or sent off, earning him the nickname Gentleman Jim. Awarded the MBE in 1964, he played his last match for Pompey a year later, helping Pompey to a 1–1 end-of-season draw at Northampton Town that secured safety from relegation. And when he retired from playing, his association with the club continued. He served Pompey as public relations officer and then secretary before accepting the position of manager in May 1977. Relegation from the Third Division was avoided, but the next year Pompey dropped down a league. After three heart attacks, Dickinson died aged 57 in 1982. The famous 'Pompey Chimes' rang hauntingly around St Mary's Church in Fratton at a packed memorial service. He is buried in Alton Cemetery. In 1998 he was included on the list of 100 Legends produced to celebrate the centenary of the Football League. Dickinson's image can be seen in the seating in the Fratton End stand in Fratton Park. In his home town of Alton there is a pub named The Gentleman Jim and Dickinson Road in Portsmouth was named in his honour."

Coached by Gerry DiNardo in his third season at LSU, the Tigers played their home games at Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The Tigers began the season with high expectations following their first 10-win season since 1987. LSU's season was highlighted by a stunning 28–21 home upset of the top ranked Florida Gators (ending Florida's 25-game winning streak in SEC play) and an Independence Bowl victory over the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, who had defeated the Tigers in Baton Rouge during the regular season. LSU also shut out Alabama 27-0 at Tuscaloosa, paying back the Crimson Tide for a 26-0 loss the previous season in Baton Rouge. Despite the highs, LSU also experienced two embarrassing home losses. The first was to Ole Miss one week after the Tigers' conquest of then-No. 1 Florida. The second was to Notre Dame, which came to Baton Rouge at 4-5, needing three consecutive victories just to qualify for a bowl. In a stunning 24-6 triumph, the Irish rushed for 232 yards and played their first penalty-free and turnover-free game in program history. LSU was also quite fortunate to escape with a 7-6 victory at Vanderbilt, DiNardo's former employer. The Commodores scored a late touchdown and were lined up to go for a 2-point conversion and a potential 8-7 win, but two delay of game penalties convinced Vanderbilt coach Woody Widenhofer to instead play for overtime. LSU's Arnold Miller preserved the win by blocking the kick. The Tigers tied for the SEC West title for the 2nd straight year, but Auburn had won a dramatic game in Baton Rouge earlier in the season and therefore represented the West in the SEC Championship."

9,49,"The  Whig Party was a political party active in the middle of the 19th century in the United States. Four Presidents belonged to the Party while in office. Along with the rival Democratic Party, it was central to the Second Party System from the early 1830s to the mid-1850s. It originally formed in opposition to the policies of President Andrew Jackson (in office 1829–37) and his Democratic Party. In particular, the Whigs supported the supremacy of Congress over the Presidency and favored a program of modernization, banking and economic protectionism to stimulate manufacturing. It appealed to entrepreneurs and planters, but had little appeal to farmers or unskilled workers. It included many active Protestants, and voiced a moralistic opposition to the Jacksonian Indian removal policies. Party founders chose the \""Whig\"" name to echo the American Whigs of 1776, who fought for independence. \""Whig\"" meant opposing tyranny. Historian Frank Towers has specified a deep ideological divide: Democrats stood for the 'sovereignty of the people' as expressed in popular demonstrations, constitutional conventions, and majority rule as a general principle of governing, whereas Whigs advocated the rule of law, written and unchanging constitutions, and protections for minority interests against majority tyranny. The Whig Party nominated several presidential candidates in 1836. General William Henry Harrison of Ohio was nominated in the 1840. Preeminent leader Henry Clay of Kentucky in 1844. General Zachary Taylor of Virginia in 1848. Another war-hero, General Winfield Scott of Virginia was the Whig Party's last presidential nominee in the 1852. In its two decades of existence, the Whig Party had two of its candidates, Harrison and Taylor, elected President. Both died in office. John Tyler succeeded to the Presidency after Harrison's death in 1841, but was expelled from the party. Millard Fillmore, who became President after Taylor's death in 1850, was the last Whig president. The party fell apart because of the internal tension over the expansion of slavery to the territories. With deep fissures in the party on this question, the anti-slavery faction prevented the nomination for a full-term of its own incumbent, President Fillmore, in the 1852 presidential election; instead, the party nominated General Scott. Most Whig Party leaders eventually quit politics (as Abraham Lincoln did temporarily) or changed parties. The northern voter-base mostly gravitated to the new Republican Party. In the South, most joined the Know Nothing Party, which unsuccessfully ran Fillmore in the 1856 presidential election, by which time the Whig Party had become virtually defunct. Some former Whigs became Democrats. The Constitutional Union Party experienced significant success from conservative former Whigs in the Upper South during the 1860 presidential election. Whig ideology as a policy orientation persisted for decades and played a major role in shaping the modernizing policies of the state governments during Reconstruction."

9,34,"Craig Francis Romero (born September 25, 1954) is a New Iberia corporate salesman who represented District 22 in the Louisiana State Senate from 1993 to 2008. The district includes the parishes of Iberia, Lafayette, St. Martin, and Vermilion. Romero was president of the Iberia Parish government from 1984 to 1992. He unsuccessfully ran as a Republican for the U.S. House of Representatives in Louisiana's Third Congressional District in both 2004 and 2006. In 2004, Romero ran for the Third District seat but finished third in the state's unique jungle primary. The seat in question was formerly held from 1980 to 2005 by Wilbert Joseph \""Billy\"" Tauzin, Jr., a Democrat-turned-Republican. In the 2004 race, Romero faced the retiring Tauzin's son, Republican Billy Tauzin III and Democrat Charlie Melancon of Napoleonville, the seat of Assumption Parish, a sugar lobbyist and former State Representative with a long family history in Louisiana's sugar industry. The race was highly controversial, as the elder Tauzin convinced the state Republican party to endorse his son, upsetting many of Romero's supporters and fueling charges of nepotism. In the home stretch of the race, the Tauzin campaign released several advertisements accusing Romero of being a liberal, most notably claiming that he supported the legalization of sodomy. Under the jungle primary system, if the leading candidate does not receive over 50 percent of the vote, the top two finishers in a race - regardless of party affiliation - advance to a runoff election, which is held several weeks after the national general election. On election day, Romero missed the primary by a razor-thin margin, receiving 22 percent of the vote to Melancon's 23 percent and Tauzin's 32 percent. Another factor contributing to Romero's defeat may have been his refusal in 2003 to endorse the Republican candidate for governor, Bobby Jindal, who lost to the Democrat Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Lafayette.Romero remained upset with Tauzin over his campaign's negative attacks and the manner in which the state party endorsed him, and thus remained neutral for the runoff, refusing to endorse Tauzin. Melancon defeated Tauzin by just over 500 votes, leading many political observers to speculate that the rift with Romero and his supporters cost Tauzin the election. In 2006, Romero ran for the seat again as the only GOP candidate. (map). In a year adverse to Republicans nationally, Romero was handily defeated by freshman incumbent Democrat Melancon in the November 7, 2006, midterm election. In addition to a political atmosphere hostile to Republicans and the natural advantage of incumbency, some pundits have speculated that Melancon benefited from a \""halo effect\"" for what was perceived to be a strong response to Hurricane Katrina."

Forman had three brothers, John and Adam who were both knights — Adam was the standard-bearer to King James IV at the Battle of Flodden and John was the king's serjeant-porter who was captured at the battle — and Robert who was dean of Glasgow cathedral. He also had two known sisters—Isabel, the second wife of Sir Patrick Home of Fast Castle and an unnamed sister whose son, John Roul, became commendator of May after Forman's death. A possible third sister, Jonet Forman the Prioress of Eklis (Eccles), is the first named in a letter of protection and respite (similar to a will) dated 28 March 1513, when Forman lists a number of his kith and kin. Like many senior churchmen of his day, his vow of celibacy was not one that he kept and was known to have had a daughter Jane who married Sir Alexander Oliphant of Kellie. He was educated at the University of St Andrews graduating as a Licentiate of the Arts in 1483. By 1489, Forman had entered the service of King James IV whom he represented in Rome in 1489/90 and where he was appointed protonotary apostolic by Pope Innocent VIII. King James’s foreign policy was directed at bringing peace to Europe and required Forman to spend extended periods in Rome, Paris and London. During his ambassadorial career Forman gained many church and lay endowments. The king's death at Flodden and that of his son Alexander, Archbishop of St Andrews, triggered a round of attempted seizures of senior ecclesiastical offices in Scotland. Forman eventually emerged with his appointment to the archbishopric of St Andrews in 1514 which he held until his death in 1521."

It was the fifth round of the 1995 Formula One season. The 78-lap race was won by Michael Schumacher for the Benetton team after starting from second position. Damon Hill finished second for Williams after starting from pole position and leading the first 23 laps of the race, ahead of Gerhard Berger in a Ferrari car. The remaining points-scoring positions were filled by Johnny Herbert in the second Benetton, Mark Blundell (McLaren) and Heinz-Harald Frentzen (Sauber). Schumacher's win was his third of the season thus far and extended his lead in the World Drivers' Championship over Hill to five points. It was also Renault's first win in the Monaco Grand Prix, as Benetton's engine supplier. Schumacher won the race comfortably, over 30 seconds ahead of Hill. Hill's speed advantage in qualifying, in which he had set a lap time almost one second faster than Schumacher, vanished in the race, enabling Schumacher to follow him closely from the start, despite carrying a heavier fuel load for a one-stop pit strategy, as opposed to Hill's two. When Hill made his first pit stop, Schumacher took the lead, and stayed ahead of his rival for the remainder of the race. Hill also dropped behind the one-stopping Ferrari of Jean Alesi, but the latter crashed on lap 42 whilst attempting to avoid the lapped Ligier of Martin Brundle, who had spun in front of him. Hill's Williams team-mate, David Coulthard, retired from the race due to a gearbox failure after initially running in third place. In total, sixteen of the 26 entrants failed to finish, including both drivers for the Simtek team, which subsequently ran out of money and withdrew from the sport before the Canadian Grand Prix. The race was also marked by an accident at the first corner of the first lap involving Coulthard, Alesi and Berger, which caused the track to become blocked and the race to be restarted as a result."

The event is held in Delaware twice a year, with the spring event being held over Memorial Day and the fall event being held over Columbus Day weekend. Most of the planners and participants come from the Baltimore- Washington DC metropolitan area and surrounding states including, but not limited to, Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey; though more than a few come from as far away as New England. Playa del Fuego is a camping event that celebrates art for art's sake and espouses a gift economy where no vending, sales or barter are permitted. Visual and performance artists from all over the mid-atlantic region and the East Coast create a temporary community for the weekend. Participants share a wide range of talents from sculpting, painting, music, theatre, and DJing, to alternative forms of expression such as games, performance art, and circus talents such as juggling and fire spinning. The event adheres to the ten principles of the Burning Man event in Nevada. Among these are the LNT (Leave No Trace) philosophy, an environmental policy whereby participants are obligated to remove every piece of refuse that they generate while at the event, taking it with them when they leave. The themes of radical self-expression and radical self-reliance are also borrowed from Burning Man. In addition, the event is considered a \""no spectators\"" event, meaning that all attendees are expected to actively participate in its creation, staffing, and general philosophy. According to the official website, it is \""a celebration of the spirit of radical self-expression, community, and participation\"". The event is planned and run completely by volunteers. The volunteer areas include: The PDF Rangers, Medical Crew (MASH), Gate Crew, DPW/Moop, Participation Station, Stage (DJs), Lamp Lighters, and Sound Patrol. Gates open for Playa del Fuego late Thursday afternoon of the event weekend.

9,47,"Richard McKay Rorty (October 4, 1931 – June 8, 2007) was an American philosopher. Educated at the University of Chicago and Yale University, he had strong interests and training in both the history of philosophy and contemporary analytic philosophy, the latter of which came to comprise the main focus of his work at Princeton University in the 1960s. He subsequently came to reject the tradition of philosophy according to which knowledge involves correct representation (a \""mirror of nature\"") of a world whose existence remains wholly independent of that representation. Rorty had a long and diverse academic career, including positions as Stuart Professor of Philosophy at Princeton University, Kenan Professor of Humanities at the University of Virginia, and Professor of Comparative Literature at Stanford University. Among his most influential books are Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature (1979), Consequences of Pragmatism (1982), and Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity (1989). Rorty saw the idea of knowledge as a \""mirror of nature\"" as pervasive throughout the history of western philosophy. Against this approach, Rorty advocated for a novel form of American pragmatism, sometimes called neopragmatism, in which scientific and philosophical methods form merely a set of contingent \""vocabularies\"" which people abandon or adopt over time according to social conventions and usefulness. Abandoning representationalist accounts of knowledge and language, Rorty believed, would lead to a state of mind he referred to as \""ironism,\"" in which people become completely aware of the contingency of their placement in history and of their philosophical vocabulary. Rorty tied this brand of philosophy to the notion of \""social hope\""; he believed that without the representationalist accounts, and without metaphors between the mind and the world, human society would behave more peacefully. He also emphasized the reasons why the interpretation of culture as conversation (Bernstein 1971), constitutes the crucial concept of a \""postphilosophical\"" culture determined to abandon representationalist accounts of traditional epistemology, incorporating American pragmatist naturalism that considers the natural sciences as an advance towards liberalism."

1,48,"The constitutional crisis of 1993 was a political stand-off between the Russian president Boris Yeltsin and the Russian parliament that was resolved by using military force. The relations between the president and the parliament had been deteriorating for some time. The constitutional crisis reached a tipping point on September 21, 1993, when President Yeltsin aimed to dissolve the country's legislature (the Congress of People's Deputies and its Supreme Soviet), although the president did not have the power to dissolve the parliament according to the constitution. Yeltsin used the results of the referendum of April 1993 to justify his actions. In response, the parliament declared that the president's decision was null and void, impeached Yeltsin and proclaimed vice president Aleksandr Rutskoy to be acting president. The situation deteriorated at the beginning of October. On October 3, demonstrators removed police cordons around the parliament and, urged by their leaders, took over the Mayor's offices and tried to storm the Ostankino television centre. The army, which had initially declared its neutrality, stormed the Supreme Soviet building in the early morning hours of October 4 by Yeltsin's order, and arrested the leaders of the resistance. The ten-day conflict became the deadliest single event of street fighting in Moscow's history since the Russian Revolution. According to government estimates, 187 people were killed and 437 wounded, while estimates from non-governmental sources put the death toll at as high as 2,000."

Since 2005, these streets have been open to two-way traffic from Broadway until their end at Patterson Park. Although Lombard is also a two-way street from Fulton Avenue to Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, Pratt is still one-way eastbound in this area. To the east of Patterson Park, both Pratt and Lombard Streets start again. Pratt continues as a side street from Linwood Avenue until Haven Street. Pratt Street has historic significance as the location of the Baltimore Riot of 1861. Today it is known for being an important gateway into the Inner Harbor, connecting it with the Baltimore Light Rail line. It is for the latter reason that the city decided to redesign the street and surrounding area to be more pedestrian-friendly. Pratt Street is named for Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden a supporter of Civil liberties in the 18th Century, and not the noted Baltimorean Enoch Pratt (1808-1896).

He was in the starting lineup for the franchise's inaugural game on April 19 against the defending champion Boston Red Stockings, batting third and playing in right field. The New Haven club spent much of the year in dire financial circumstances, and in August and September it played a series of exhibitions in New York and Canada in an effort to control the financial bleeding. During this trip, the team stayed in London, Ontario's Tecumseh House hotel. When the team checked out, the hotel's owners noticed that Luff and his roommate Billy Geer seemed to have more luggage than they'd had when they checked into the hotel. An investigation revealed that several valuable items of clothing, including a fur coat, were missing, and when the hotel contacted the New Haven team, they turned the matter over to the police. The stolen items were discovered in Luff and Geer's shared room in a New Haven boarding house, and both players were arrested by the police and released from their contracts by the Elm Citys. Luff subsequently claimed that the items had been taken by Geer, and that he had no knowledge of the thefts. After the arrests, stolen items from a hotel in Scranton, Pennsylvania at which the team had previously stayed were also discovered in Geer's room. Luff was unusual among players of his time, in that he had a college degree and prospects of a career outside baseball, and played baseball simply because he enjoyed the game. Before the start of his playing career, he worked as a clerk, and after his retirement as a player, he became a civil engineer. Luff is buried at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

This university obtains approval from UGC and Government of People's Republic of Bangladesh. Pundra (also known as Pundra, Paundra, Paundraya, etc.) was the branch of one of the most developed civilizations of ancient west Bengal, now a part of northern Bangladesh. The civilization of Pundra was not established overnight—it had to go through the evolutionary process of thousands of years. A considerable number of Bangladeshi people today are actually the successors of the people of the Pundra civilization. We cannot deny the fact that we are very much indebted to the Pundra civilization for all that we have today—for example, our education, culture, customs, social values etc. Pundra civilization represented a huge prosperous mixed population with its strong central government—it had a strong administrative and political system along with an enriched economic background of a well-established commercial center. With a sophisticated touch of water tank technology, Pundra was one of the important civilizations which had a cluster of villages surrounded by noticeable walls all along. To talk about its technology, it should be mentioned that its walls had been built three hundred years before the Great Wall of China. Its agriculture developed on a splendid combination of the river ‘Karatoa’ and other lakes; and in fact, this formed the basic layout of Pundra civilization. With the succession of Stone Age, Iron Age, Bronze Age; the Pundra civilization flourished from every aspect—navigation, astrology, astronomy, mathematics, philosophy, theology etc. Furthermore, it helped flourish art and literature—for example, epic, folk literature, and other types of literature especially those that survived orally generations after generations came into written text at that time. The Pundra civilization showed a great thirst for knowledge; the establishment of the ancient university ‘Vashubiharh’ stood as a testimony of that. The social ideas, values, customs, philosophy, and humanity of the Pundra civilization soon earned a worldwide recognition.

8,57,"The Borneo shark (Carcharhinus borneensis) is a species of requiem shark, and part of the family Carcharhinidae. Extremely rare, it is known only from inshore waters around Mukah in northwestern Borneo, though it may once have been more widely distributed. A small, gray shark reaching 65 cm (26 in) in length, this species is the only member of its genus with a row of enlarged pores above the corners of its mouth. It has a slender body with a long, pointed snout and a low second dorsal fin placed posterior to the anal fin origin. Almost nothing is known about the natural history of the Borneo shark. It is viviparous like other requiem sharks; the females bear litters of six pups, which are provisioned through gestation by a placental connection. The International Union for Conservation of Nature last assessed this species as Endangered, at which time it had not been seen since 1937. While an extant population has since been found, the Borneo shark continues to merit conservation concern given its highly limited range within heavily fished waters."

8,57,"Eubrachyura is a group of crustaceans (ranked as a \""section\"") comprising the more advanced crabs. It is divided into two subsections, based on the position of the genital openings in the two sexes. In the Heterotremata, the openings are on the legs in the males, but on the sternum in females, while in the Thoracotremata, the openings are on the sternum in both sexes. This contrasts with the situation in other decapods, in which the genital openings are always on the legs. Heterotremata is the larger of the two groups, containing the species rich superfamilies Xanthoidea and Pilumnoidea and all the freshwater crabs (Gecarcinucoidea, Potamoidea). The fossil record of Eubrachyura extends back to the Cretaceous; the supposed Bathonian (Middle Jurassic) representative of the group, Hebertides jurassica, ultimately turned out to be Cenozoic in age."

Sefati achieved the highest jurisprudence degree (Ijtihad), an accomplishment made only by a small number of women. Her Ijtihad degree was approved by several ayatollahs, including Ayatollahs Ali Yari Gharavi-Tabrizi (a student of Ayatollah Naeini), Safi Gulpaygani, Fazel Lankarani, and Mohammad Hassan Ahmadi Faqih. Sefati has also co-founded a theology school for women in Qom, which later became known as Maktab-e Tawhid. Sefati was one of the 3,000 exemplary women commended by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and received (and accepted) a plaque of honor from the president in October 2006. Sefati has two brothers. One is Gholāmḥusayn Ṣefātī-Dezfūlī (1952–1977) who was a member of the radical anti-capitalist group “Manṣūrān.” Her other brother, Īraj Ṣefātī-Dezfūlī (b. 1940), represented the city of Abadan in the first and fifth Majlis (Iranian parliament) and was a member of the Majlis’ Supreme Audit Court. Sefati and some male jurists, such as Yousef Saanei, believe a female mujtahid can become a source of emulation (a marja), i.e. that both men and women can perform taqlid (emulation) of a woman mujtahid. Most Shiite mujtahids, however, believe that women cannot become marjas."

Saban initially dismissed this characterization, but came to accept it later in life. He held 21 coaching jobs during his 50-year career, which ended with a job at Chowan University in North Carolina between 2001 and 2002. Saban's combined record as a coach in the AFL and NFL was 95–99–7. His college football record was 94–99–4.

He has argued that these two conflicting philosophies are in fact compatible. He is currently the George Kneller Chair in the Philosophy of Education in the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. Kellner was an early theorist of the field of critical media literacy and has been a leading theorist of media culture generally. In his recent work, he has increasingly argued that media culture has become dominated by the forms of spectacle and mega-spectacle. He also has contributed important studies of alter-globalization processes, and has always been concerned with counter-hegemonic movements and alternative cultural expressions in the name of a more radically democratic society. More recently, he is known for his work exploring the politically oppositional potentials of new media and attempted to delineate what they term \""multiple technoliteracies\"" as a movement away from the present attempt to standardize a corporatist form of computer literacy.

United won the Premier League title for the sixth time in eight seasons (with a record 18-point margin and 97 goals scored), but surrendered their European Cup title with a 3–2 defeat by eventual champions Real Madrid in the quarter-finals.

It was built by Edward I during his invasion of Wales between 1282 and 1289 at the substantial cost of £8,190. Over the next few centuries, the castle played an important part in several wars, withstanding the siege of Madog ap Llywelyn between 1294–95, but falling to Owain Glyndŵr in 1404. It then became Glyndŵr's residence and military headquarters for the remainder of the uprising until being recaptured by English forces in 1409. During the 15th century Wars of the Roses, Harlech was held by the Lancastrians for seven years, before Yorkist troops forced its surrender in 1468, a siege memorialised in the song Men of Harlech. Following the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642, the castle was held by forces loyal to Charles I, holding out until 1647 when it became the last fortification to surrender to the Parliamentary armies. In the 21st century the ruined castle is managed by Cadw, the Welsh Government's historic environment service, as a tourist attraction. UNESCO considers Harlech to be one of \""the finest examples of late 13th century and early 14th century military architecture in Europe\"", and it is classed as a World Heritage site. The fortification is built of local stone and concentric in design, featuring a massive gatehouse that probably once provided high-status accommodation for the castle constable and visiting dignitaries. The sea originally came much closer to Harlech than in modern times, and a water-gate and a long flight of steps leads down from the castle to the former shore, which allowed the castle to be resupplied by sea during sieges. In keeping with Edward's other castles in North Wales, the architecture of Harlech has close to links to that found in the County of Savoy during the same period, an influence probably derived from the Savoy origins of the main architect, James of Saint George."

1,48,"The Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War began in September 2015 after an official request by the Syrian government for military help against rebel and jihadist groups. The intervention initially consisted of air strikes fired by Russian aircraft stationed in the Khmeimim base at targets primarily in north-western Syria, against militant groups opposed to the Syrian government, including Syrian National Coalition, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), al-Nusra Front (al-Qaeda in the Levant) and the Army of Conquest. Besides, Russian military advisors and special operations forces were stationed in Syria. Prior to the intervention, Russian involvement in the Syrian Civil War had mainly consisted of supplying the Syrian Army. Shortly after the operation began, Russian officials were cited as saying that, apart from fighting terrorist organisations such as ISIL, Russia′s goals included helping the Syrian government retake territory from various anti-government groups that are labelled by the U.S. and its coalition as ″moderate opposition″, a broader geopolitical objective being to roll back U.S. influence. In his televised interview broadcast on 11 October 2015, Russian president Vladimir Putin said the military operation had been thoroughly prepared in advance; he defined Russia′s goal in Syria as \""stabilising the legitimate power in Syria and creating the conditions for political compromise\"" According to the U.S. State Department, the Russian government has also been concerned that \""if the government fell, that there would be chaos and that would allow terrorist groups to consolidate\"", a claim which the Russian government has been using to justify their intervention. The intervention has produced significant gains for the Syrian government, including the recapture of Palmyra from ISIL in March 2016 and according to the U.S. State Department, one year after the start of their intervention the Russians \""have succeeded in bolstering the [Syrian] regime.\"" The pro-opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has stated that between the initiation of the intervention in September 2015 and end of February 2016, Russian air strikes have killed at least 1,700 civilians, including more than 200 children. The Syrian Network for Human Rights puts the number even higher, and in its report stated that Russian attacks have killed more civilians than either ISIS or Assad's army. Used weapons included unguided bombs, cluster bombs, incendiaries similar to white phosphorus and thermobaric weapons. By end of September 2016, the pro-rebel Syrian Observatory for Human Rights stated that Russian airstrikes have killed around 3800 civilians, about a quarter of them children, along with 2,746 ISIS fighters, and 2,814 rebels. The U.S. government publicly accused Russia of ″flagrant violations of international law″ in Syria."

4,22,"\""So laang we's du do bast\"" (\""As Long As You Are There\"") was Luxembourg's entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1960. Performed by Camillo Felgen, the song represented no less than three firsts for Luxembourg; firstly by being sung in Luxembourgish (all of the country's previous entries had been in French), secondly by being sung by a male singer (all previous artists representing the country had been female) and thirdly by being sung by an artist who was native to Luxembourg (all previous artists representing the Grand Duchy had been French). It failed to achieve a first in the voting, however, coming 13th out of 13 entries after receiving just one point. No commercial recording was ever made of the original Luxembourgish version by Camillo Felgen. However, he did record a German-language version 40 years later, entitled \""Solange du da bist\"". The song is in the chanson style, with Felgen telling his lover that he will continue to love her \""as long as you are there\"". If she leaves him, he sings, he will continue to do so but she won't notice. The song was performed third on the night, following \""Alla andra får varann\"" from Sweden's Siw Malmkvist and preceding \""Det var en yndig tid\"" performed by Denmark's Katy Bødtger. The song was succeeded as Luxembourgish representative at the 1961 contest by Jean-Claude Pascal with \""Nous les amoureux\"". The next native Luxembourgish artist to represent the grand duchy was Monique Melsen in 1971, singing \""Pomme, pomme, pomme\"" - in French. The next Luxembourgish entry to be sung in the Luxembourgish language was \""Sou fräi\"" at the 1992 Contest."
4,45,"For the Middle Welsh manuscript, see Book of Taliesin. The Book of Taliesyn is the second studio album by English rock band Deep Purple, recorded only three months after Shades of Deep Purple and released by Tetragrammaton Records in October 1968, just before their first US tour. The name for the album was taken from the 14th-century Book of Taliesin. The structure of the album is similar to that of their debut, with four original songs and three rearranged covers, although the tracks are longer, the arrangements more complex and the sound more polished than on Shades of Deep Purple. The music style is a mix of psychedelic rock, progressive rock and hard rock, with several inserts of classical music arranged by the band's keyboard player Jon Lord. Deep Purple's American record label aimed at a hippie audience, which was very influential in the US at the time, but the chart results of album and singles were not as high as expected. This setback did not hinder the success of the three months long US tour, when the band played in many important venues and festivals and received positive feedback from audience and press. On the contrary, Deep Purple were still an underground band which played in small clubs and colleges in the United Kingdom, largely ignored by media and public. The British record company EMI released The Book of Taliesyn only in June 1969 on the new underground prog rock sub-label Harvest Records, but the album did not chart. Even the release of the new single \""Emmaretta\"" and new dates in their home country in the summer of 1969 did not increase the album sales or the popularity of Deep Purple in the UK. Perception of the album changed in modern times, when it received more favourable reviews."

The earthquake epicenter was located in the east of Cape Shabla-Kaliakra, 30 km off northwest coast of Bulgaria. The mainshock occurred at a depth of 15 km and generated a 4–5 m high tsunami that devastated the coastal areas of Romania and Bulgaria. In Romania, the earthquake was felt not only throughout Northern Dobruja, but also in Oltenia and Muntenia, and even in southern Moldova. The earthquake was followed by a large number of local replicas and secondary earthquakes, which occurred over many years, until 1905; the strongest aftershocks reached magnitudes of 5.5-6.0 on the Richter scale and were also felt in southern Romania, including Bucharest. After 1905, Pontic seismic activity began to subside, although weak and moderate earthquakes were also reported in subsequent years. Such events are rare in the Black Sea. In the last 200 years, in the Black Sea region 24 tsunamis occurred, of which two were in the territory of Dobruja. The earliest recorded tsunami in Romania dates from 104, when the city of Callatis, current Mangalia, was badly affected."

He previously played for the Leicester Tigers in the Aviva Premiership, Crusaders in Super Rugby and Canterbury in the NPC. He can play both on the wing or at fullback. Unlike many of his peers, Hamilton did not feature in age group teams in his development years. In fact, while at school at Christchurch Boys High School, Hamilton could not make his first XV, instead playing in the third XV. However, with his skill set, and at the end of the Crusaders and Canterbury backlines, it was considered by most rugby pundits to be a formality that he would eventually go on to higher honours – a point alluded to by his nickname FABSH (Future All Black Scott Hamilton). Indeed, it was a surprise to many that it took as long as it did for him to be named in the All Black squad for the first time. He was named in the All Blacks squad to play Ireland. All Blacks coach Graham Henry said of Hamilton's All Black selection, \""We like the way he anticipates, he's got a good feel for the game in the back three. He reads the play well. He's got a huge work rate and he's deserved of selection\"". Due to an injury to All Black wing Sitiveni Sivivatu, Hamilton was promoted from the bench of the 2006 mid-year series against Ireland, to the starting 15 for the Argentina test. This was Hamilton's All Black début, and he celebrated it by scoring a match winning try in the second half. Hamilton signed a contract with Leicester Tigers in 2008.

The issues the band promoted included animal rights, anarchism, environmentalism, anti war, vegetarianism, veganism, antiglobalisation, feminism and the negative effects of organised religion. Members of the band were involved with various campaign groups such as The Direct Action Movement, Hunt Saboteurs, Animal Liberation Front, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), London Greenpeace, Peace Pledge Union and gave support to the women campaigning at Greenham Common cruise missile base. Live shows were often used to raise money for these causes and also others including Rock Against Racism and the UK miners' strike (1984–85). Due to the anti-establishment stance of the band many shows were banned by local authorities across the UK and gigs attracted a heavy Police presence often in full riot gear. Various far right groups also attempted to disrupt the band playing, and many shows were marred by violence from right wing skinheads.

7,12,"The New Karolinska Solna University Hospital (NKS) (Swedish: Nya Karolinska Solna), is the new university hospital to be built in Stockholm, Sweden, replacing the present Karolinska University Hospital. Estimated completion is December 2015. NKS is also Sweden's first public-private partnership (PPP) project in healthcare. The process for contracting, planning and building the hospital has been heavily criticized by an independent review published by Timbro. When the hospital was planned, there was an inadequate assessment of the costs of renovating the old Karolinska and the focus was on architectural design and only after a competition had been held was there feedback from a medical perspective. The hospital is smaller than the current Karolinska and does not meet the future needs of an ageing population with increasing healthcare demands. The contracting of the hospital was also not performed correctly as there was only one bid on the tender. The cost of the hospital is currently estimated to 50 000 million SEK and this does not take into account the costs of increasing the number of beds in other Stockholm hospitals or alternatively keeping the old Karolinska to have sufficient number of hospital beds for future needs. The building costs widely exceed those of other, similar projects in Europe and the US. The contracts and details of the New Karolinska have been classified as confidential information despite the bill being picked up by Stockholm taxpayers."

Adopted by Congress on March 13, 1863, the Conscription Act authorized President Abraham Lincoln to draft men into military service in states that did not meet their volunteer quotas. When Federal officials tried to enforce the act in Holmes County in June, about 900 to 1000 locals built a makeshift fort, equipped with four artillery pieces, to prevent the act's enforcement. After a brief encounter in which two resisters were wounded, Ohio Governor David Tod ordered a force of nearly 420 Union troops, including the 3rd Ohio Infantry, to disperse the resisters, giving the place the name \""Fort Fizzle\"" because the rebellion had \""fizzled out\"". The episode ended when the last four resisters who had assaulted a Federal draft official turned themselves in. Forty-three men from the Napoleon area were indicted for assaulting an officer and preventing the execution of law (US Military Conscription Act of 1863). The armed men involved in the prisoner rescue were indicted for treason.

He represented Kent County Cricket Club and is a former member of the England Test match and One Day International sides. A right-handed opening batsman, Key made appearances at age-group level for Kent from the age of eleven, moving up until he made his first-class debut in 1998. He made eight first-class and 4 List A appearances for England's youth sides, and was a member of the side which won the 1998 Under-19 Cricket World Cup.

8,57,"The white-winged fairywren (Malurus leucopterus) is a species of passerine bird in the fairywren family Maluridae. It lives in the drier parts of central Australia; from central Queensland and South Australia across to Western Australia. Like other fairywrens, this species displays marked sexual dimorphism and one or more males of a social group grow brightly coloured plumage during the breeding season. The female is sandy-brown with light-blue tail feathers; it is smaller than the male, which, in breeding plumage, has a bright-blue body, black bill, and white wings. Younger sexually mature males are almost indistinguishable from females and are often the breeding males. A troop of white-winged fairywrens in spring and summer has a brightly coloured older male accompanied by small, inconspicuous brown birds, many of which are also male. Three subspecies are recognised. Apart from the mainland subspecies, one is found on Dirk Hartog Island, and another on Barrow Island off the coast of Western Australia. Males from these islands have black rather than blue breeding plumage. The white-winged fairywren mainly eats insects, supplementing this with small fruits and leaf buds. It occurs in heathland and arid scrubland, where low shrubs provide cover. Like other fairywrens, it is a cooperative breeding species, and small groups of birds maintain and defend territories year-round. Groups consist of a socially monogamous pair with several helper birds who assist in raising the young. These helpers are progeny that have attained sexual maturity but remain with the family group for one or more years after fledging. Although not yet confirmed genetically, the white-winged fairywren may be promiscuous and assist in raising the young from other pairings. As part of a courtship display, the male wren plucks petals from flowers and displays them to female birds."
9,47,"Apiashal had been an early monarch (fl. c. 2205 BCE — c. 2192 BCE) of the Early Period of Aššūrāyu (Assyria) according to the Assyrian King List (AKL). He is listed within the section of the AKL as the last of whom, \""altogether seventeen kings, tent dwellers.\"" This section shows marked similarities to the ancestors of the First Babylonian Dynasty. The AKL also states that Apiashal had been preceded by his father Ushpia (fl. c. 2218 BCE — c. 2205 BCE.) Additionally, the AKL states that Apiashal had been succeeded by his son Hale (fl. c. 2192 BCE — c. 2179 BCE.) Apiashal is also listed within a section of the AKL as the first out of the ten, \""kings whose fathers are known.” This section (which in contrast to the rest of the list) had been written in reverse order—beginning with Aminu (fl. c. 2088 BCE — c. 2075 BCE.) and ending with Apiashal, \""altogether ten kings who are ancestors\""—has often been interpreted as the list of ancestors of the Amorite Šamši-Adad I (fl. c. 1754 BCE — c. 1721 BCE) who had conquered the city-state of Aššur. In keeping with this assumption, scholars have inferred that the original form of the Assyrian King List had been written (among other things) as an, “attempt to justify that Šamši-Adad I was a legitimate ruler of the city-state Aššur and to obscure his non-Assyrian antecedents by incorporating his ancestors into a native Assyrian genealogy.” However, this interpretation has not been accepted universally; the Cambridge Ancient History rejected this interpretation and instead interpreted the section as being that of the ancestors of Sulili (fl. c. 2075 BCE — c. 2062 BCE.) Very little is otherwise known of Apiashal's reign."

4,53,"Spelunx and the Caves of Mr. Seudo is an educational computer game intended for young children developed by Cyan (now Cyan Worlds) in 1991. It was designed by the brothers Robyn and Rand Miller (better known now as the creators of Myst). The game was programmed and implemented using HyperCard, with Robyn Miller hand-drawing all of the in-game graphics and scenery. The game's title was derived from the verb \""to spelunk\"", referring to the act of exploring caves. Although Spelunx contained a basic frame story (centered on the scientific endeavors of one Professor Spelunx and his willing assistant, Mr. Seudo), there was no other plot. As a game, it was intended to be explored and played with—like a toy—rather than completed or won. Although the characters Professor Spelunx and Mr. Seudo are mentioned (and even depicted in-game) the player never meets them. Spelunx was an early first-person point-and-click adventure game. It was structured as a collection of rooms connected by a series of underground tunnels (accessed via elevator). Each room contained interactive mini-games and experiments, most of which were designed to introduce the player to a specific field of knowledge. A hidden control panel within the game allowed for the rearrangement of the caves and other locations, and even allowed for the expansion of the caves with the addition of newer rooms. Although it was the intention of Cyan to continue releasing new rooms over time for players to explore, this never occurred. In 1993, following the release of Myst, Cyan produced a colorized version of Spelunx. Although the original monochrome version contained small amounts of color at specific locations or during specific events (utilizing MacroMind Player, a predecessor of Adobe Flash), this new version (colorized by artist Josh Staub) contained full-color scenery and animation (as well as a small easter egg: an image of Myst Island hidden within one of the original rooms). More recently, the color version has been ported to Windows and released on the Steam digital distribution service as part of the Cyan Complete Pack, alongside other early Cyan titles (including Myst)."

4,18,"Gradhiva is an anthropological and museological journal, founded in 1986 by the poet and social scientist Michel Leiris and by the anthropologist Jean Jamin. It is since 2005 published by the Musée du Quai Branly in Paris. Its title derives from a novel by W. Jensen (Gradiva) which was the basis for a famous investigation by Sigmund Freud, and that strongly inspired the Surrealists. Leiris ans Jamin inserted an “H” in the word to highlight that the journal focused on the History of anthropology, and that the editing was done at the Musée de l'Homme in Paris. The title thus became the acronym \""Groupe de Recherches et d'Analyses Documentaires sur l'HIstoire et les Variations de l'Anthropologie}\"" (\""Research and Documentary Analysis Group, History and Variations of Anthropology). It was edited by Jean Jamin between 1986 and 1996, by Françoise Zonabend from 1996 to 2006, and by Erwan Dianteill from 2006 until 2008. Initially dedicated to the history and the archives of anthropology, it maintained its original mission, yet latterly opened up to a greater extent to contemporary developments of anthropology and museology. Based on original examinations and the publication of archives, 'Gradhiva was open to a variety of disciplines: ethnology, aesthetics, history, art history, sociology, literature and even music. Finally, it sought to develop an interaction between the text and images through high-quality and original iconography. In 2007, the anthropologist Sally Price ended her review article on Gradhiva in The Museum Anthropology Review by saying: Gradhiva was published by the French publisher Jean Michel Place until 2004. In 2009, the journal was retitled as Anthropology of Art, with a new direction."

Initially contested as a single tournament, the championship was expanded into a two-tournament series in 2014. The competition is sanctioned and sponsored by Asia Rugby, which is the rugby union governing body for the region. Rugby sevens — also known as 7-a-side, or 7s — is a short form of the sport of rugby union that was first played in 1883. The first (men's) internationals took place in 1973. As women's rugby union developed in the 1960s and 1970s the format became very popular as it allowed games, and entire leagues, to be developed in countries even when player numbers were small, and it remains the main form the women's game is played in most parts of the world. However, although the first women's international rugby union 15-a-side test match took place in 1982, it was not until 1997 before the first women's international 7s tournaments were played, when the 1997 Hong Kong Sevens included a women's tournament for the first time. Over the next decade the number of tournaments grew, with almost every region developing regular championship competitions. This reached its zenith with the first Women's Sevens World Cup in 2009, shortly followed by the announcement that women's rugby sevens would be included in the Olympics from 2016. The first official regional 7s championship for international women's teams from Asia was held in Hong Kong, played as part of the 2000 Hong Kong Sevens tournament.

5,24,"The Brodersänger or Broder singers, from Brody in Ukraine, were Jewish itinerant performers in Austrian Galicia, Romania, and Russia, professional or semiprofessional songwriters and performers, who from at least the early 19th century sang and danced, often in comic disguises, and who performed short one-act plays. They were often badchonim (traditional wedding entertainers) and meshorerim (singers in cantors' choirs). They were among the first to publicly perform Yiddish-language songs outside of Purim plays and wedding parties, and were an important precursor to Yiddish theatre. They erected miniature stages and entertained customers in taverns, wine cellars, and restaurant gardens. The first written records of the Broder singers are the remarks of Jews passing through Brody, which was a trading center on a major route of travel (\""a stopping point on the travels of Russian Jewish merchants to and from the Leipzig fair.\""). These records are generally disapproving of the singing of songs when no particular occasion called for music. Later the term Broder Singer was applied to performers who had no connection with Brody. Among the most famous Broder singers were Berl Margulis - better known as Berl Broder (1815–1868) - and Moyshe Prizament and his son Shloyme Prizament. Some of Berl Broder's original songs, along with the works of his son and grandson who continued the tradition of secular Yiddish writing, can be found in his grandson Ber Margulies' book Dray doyres̀ lider fun Berl Broder (Margulies), feliṭonen fun Yom Hatsyoni (Yitsḥaḳ Margulies), poemen un lider fun Ber Margulies (1957) (free online download from the Yiddish Book Center)."

9,47,"Wilhelm Georg Friedrich Roscher (October 21, 1817 – June 4, 1894) was a German economist from Hanover. He studied at Göttingen, where he became a member of Corps Hannovera, and Berlin, and obtained a professorship at Göttingen in 1844 and subsequently at Leipzig in 1848. The main origins of the historical school of political economy may be traced to Roscher. Its fundamental principles are dated to his Grundriss zu Vorlesungen über die Staatswirtschaft nach geschichtlicher Methode (1843). Roscher tried to establish the laws of economic development by using the historical method from the investigation of histories legal, political, cultural and other aspects. Roscher developed a cyclical theory where nations and their economies pass through youth, manhood and senile decay: “The method of a science is of greater significance by far than any single discovery, however amazing the later may be.” This was in direct contrast to the English traditional economist who believed that the principles of a science were only exposed long after they had performed their duties. This short study was afterwards expanded into his great System der Volkswirthschaft, published in five volumes between 1854 and 1894, and arranged as follows: \n*  vol. i., Die Grundlagen der National Ökonomie, 1854 (trans. by JJ Lalor, Principles of Political Economy, Chicago, 1878) (Volume One, Volume Two) \n*  vol. ii., Die Nationalökonomik des Ackerbaues und der verwandten Urproduktionen, 1859 \n*  vol. iii., Die Nationalökonomik des Handels und Gewerbfleisses, 1881 \n*  vol. iv., System der Finanzwissenschaft, 1886 \n*  vol. v., System der Armenpfiege und Armenpolitik, 1894 His Geschichte der Nationalökonomie in Deutschland (1874) is a monumental work. He also published in 1842 an excellent commentary on the life and works of Thucydides. In 1847 he was the first to use the term \""enlightened absolutism\"" about the type of absolute monarchy influenced by contemporary philosophy that evolved in the 18th century. In 1870, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Roscher died in 1894 in Leipzig. The classical scholar Wilhelm Heinrich Roscher (1845–1923) was his son."

His party, the Patriotic Salvation Movement (MPS), won nearly three-quarters of seats in the 2002 elections, but the results were condemned by observers as flawed.

Since 1990, the results of Chad's elections have been consistently disputed by opposition parties and civil organisations. This year's elections were the result of an accord signed by the ruling party and its opponents in August 2007, under the auspices of the European Union, to foster democracy in the war-torn country.

1,48,"The Battle of Oivi–Gorari (4–11 November 1942) was the final major battle of the Kokoda Track campaign before the Battle of Buna–Gona. Following the capture of Kokoda by Australian forces on 2 November, the Allies began flying in fresh supplies of ammunition and food to ease the supply problems that had slowed their advance north after the climactic battle around Ioribaiwa, coupled with reverses elsewhere, had stopped the Japanese advance on Port Moresby. On 4 November, the Australians resumed their advance, pushing towards Oivi along the Kokoda–Sanananda Track. Around the high ground at Oivi, the lead Australian element, the 16th Brigade, came up against well entrenched Japanese defenders from the South Seas Detachment who were intent on stalling the Australian advance towards the sea. Over the course of several days, determined resistance held off a number of frontal assaults, forcing the commander of the 7th Division, Major General George Vasey, to attempt a flanking move to the south.

French 4th Corps (with attached Polish division under general Valance) had to cross the bridge over the Guadiana River which was defended by the Spanish corps of Count Urbina Cartaojal. Polish lancers of the Legion of the Vistula under colonel Jan Konopka charged through the bridge taking it by surprise, then outflanked Spanish infantry and attacked it from behind as the main French and Polish forces crossed the bridge, and attacked the Spanish front lines. The battle was over when undisciplined Spanish soldiers dispersed, and began to retreat in the direction of Santa Cruz.Józef Rudnicki, adjutant-major of the 4th Infantry Regiment of the Legion, described the battle in his diaries (spelling according to the original): \""as soon as the French regiments of the 4th Corps met our division, we rushed immediately toward the Consiegra and Cuidad-Real, before of which town we found the Spanish corps, waiting for us on good positions.

9,7,"KGWN-DT2 was the CBS-affiliated television station for Northern Colorado. It was a second digital subchannel of CBS outlet KGWN-TV that is owned by Frontier Radio Management. Over-the-air, it broadcast a 720p high definition digital signal on UHF channel 30.2 (or virtual channel 5.2 via PSIP) from KGWN's transmitter in unincorporated Laramie County, Wyoming (west of Cheyenne) between I-80/U.S. 30 and WY 225. As a result, the broadcast radius of this signal did not cover Loveland and Greeley completely and areas just to the south were not able to pick up KGWN-DT2 at all. In order to increase its viewership base, the station was also seen in standard definition on Baja Broadband channel 5 and Comcast channel 14. The station maintained studios on East Mountain Avenue in downtown Fort Collins. Although identified as a separate outlet in its own right, KGWN-DT2 was actually considered a semi-satellite of parent station KGWN in Cheyenne. It cleared all network programming as provided through its parent and syndicated shows although some programs are seen at a different time. This station also aired separate on-air identifications and local commercials. Although KGWN-DT2 maintained its own studios, master control and some internal operations were based out of KGWN's facility on East Lincolnway/East 14th Street/I-80 Business/U.S. 30 in Cheyenne. KGWN has long claimed Northern Colorado as part of its primary coverage area even though the region is part of the Denver market, mainly because KGWN's transmitter is very close to the Colorado line. The main KGWN signal has been carried on cable systems in Fort Collins, Loveland, and Greeley for nearly five decades alongside Denver's CBS affiliate (originally KMGH-TV and now network owned-and-operated KCNC-TV). Additionally, many cable systems in Wyoming carry both KGWN and KCNC. In May 2013, SagamoreHill Broadcasting reached a deal to sell KGWN to Yellowstone Holdings, a subsidiary of Frontier Radio Management. On November 4, 2013, Gray Television announced a deal to acquire Yellowstone Holdings for $23 million. KGWN-TV and KGWN-DT2 will be operated under a local marketing agreement by Gray until the closure of the deal.

9,13,"Earle Francis Brucker Sr. (May 6, 1901 – May 8, 1981) was an American catcher, coach and interim manager in Major League Baseball. After a long minor league career in the Pacific Coast and Western leagues – and after missing three full seasons (1927–29) in his prime due to arm trouble – Brucker was an unusually old rookie player in the Major Leagues. He made his debut on April 19, 1937, not quite three weeks shy of his 36th birthday. Born in Albany, New York, Brucker threw and batted right-handed, stood 5 ft 11 in (1.80 m) (180 cm) tall and weighed 175 pounds (79 kg). He made his first appearance in professional baseball in 1924 for the Seattle Indians of the Pacific Coast League, but it would be 13 years before he would reach the majors. He was even a playing manager in the Western League during this apprenticeship. He played his entire MLB career (1937–40; 1943) for the Philadelphia Athletics and served as a coach under legendary A's manager Connie Mack for nine full seasons, 1941–49. In 241 total games, he batted .290 in 707 at bats, with 12 home runs and 105 runs batted in. In 1938, his best campaign, Brucker batted .374 with 64 hits in 171 at bats, three homers and 35 RBI. During his long tenure with Philadelphia, he also witnessed the brief major-league career of his son Earle Brucker Jr., also a catcher, who appeared in two games for the Athletics at the end of the 1948 season. After leaving the A's, Brucker Sr. coached for the St. Louis Browns (1950) and the Cincinnati Reds (1952). During the latter season, from July 30 to August 3, he served as interim manager of the Reds for five games during the transition between Luke Sewell and Rogers Hornsby as Cincinnati's permanent manager. His sixth-place Reds won three of five during his brief tenure. Following that season, Brucker managed in the Reds' farm system for two additional campaigns before leaving the game. In 1960, Brucker was also inducted by the San Diego Hall of Champions into the Breitbard Hall of Fame honoring San Diego's finest athletes both on and off the playing surface.

8,57,"The Réunion pink pigeon (Nesoenas duboisi, but see below) is an extinct species of pigeon that formerly lived on the Mascarene island of Réunion. It is known from the description of a rusty-red pigeon given by Dubois in 1674 and a single subfossil humerus that agrees with that of the pink pigeon of Mauritius in generic characteristics, except being slightly longer. Also, Dubois' reference to the bill being red at the base and the eyes being surrounded by a red ring suggest that this species was closely allied to the Mauritus taxon. Dubois' description was as follows: wild pigeons, everywhere full with them, some with slaty-coloured feathering [Alectroenas?], the others russet-red [N. duboisi]. They are a little larger than the European pigeons, and have larger bills, red at the end close to the head, the eyes ringed with the colour of fire, like pheasants. There is a season when they are so fat that one can no longer see their cloaca [croupion]. They are very good tasting. Wood-pigeons and turtle-doves, as one sees in Europe and as good. Its genus Nesoenas was often synonymized with Columba in the past, but more recently it has been synonymized with Streptopelia. As the pink pigeon and the Madagascar turtle dove cannot be firmly placed in either of these two genera but apparently represent a distinct lineage that diverged early, probably from the ancestor of Streptopelia, it seems (at least for the time being) to be best to separate them again in Nesoenas. This restores the genus of the Réunion pink pigeon to the one it was originally described under. There seem to have been one to three other species of columbid on Réunion (not counting the invalidated \""Réunion solitaire\""). Willem Ysbrandtszoon Bontekoe mentioned ramiers (doves) with blue wings in 1619 as being abundant; apparently a species of Alectroenas. Dubois, on the other hand, referred to no less than four kinds of pigeons: ramiers, tourterelles (turtle doves) and two kinds of pigeon, one rusty red - the present species -, the other slate grey. Either the ramiers or the tourterelles of Dubois could refer to a local population of the Madagascar Turtle Dove, possibly an extinct subspecies, which is known from one subfossil humerus and one ulna. The slate-grey bird or the ramiers, respectively, seem to be the birds described by Bontekoe. What the remaining form - the tourterelles or the slate-grey pigeons, respectively - might have been is completely unresolvable at this time, although the possibility of it being a relative of the Rodrigues grey pigeon cannot be entirely discounted."

On that day, half of the regiment led North Korean forces against South Korean troops by land and sea, pushing them back after several days of fighting. Over the next six weeks the regiment advanced slowly down the Korean Peninsula, acting as a forward unit of the North Korean army. Suffering from a lack of supplies and mounting casualties, the regiment was committed to the Battle of Pusan Perimeter as part of a push to force United Nations (UN) troops out of Korea. The regiment saw its final action at the Battle of P'ohang-dong, fighting unsuccessfully to take the town from U.N. troops.

9,13,"Paul John Kevin Mooney (born 15 October 1976) is an Irish cricketer. A member of the successful North County, Mooney is a medium-pace bowler and competent lower-order batsman. He first appeared for Ireland in 1998 against Marylebone Cricket Club at Lurgan. He is the elder brother of fellow Irish squadmate John. Mooney has often reserved his best efforts at international level for fixtures involving more exalted opposition, most notably against Zimbabwe at Clontarf in June 2000, when he removed both Andy and Grant Flower for nought in the process of contributing 4-24 to Ireland's forlorn defence of a meagre total. Three years later, Mooney's 2-19 was a crucial component of Ireland's 10-wicket victory over the same opposition at Stormont. He also featured in Ireland's historic victory over the West Indies at the Belfast venue in June 2004, when three valuable wickets mitigated the 67 runs Mooney surrendered off his ten overs. Mooney, a survivor of Ireland's disastrous 2001 ICC Trophy campaign in Canada (where his 4-17 against Bermuda emerged as a rare highlight of a catastrophic tour), featured in all six matches at the 2005 event, which Ireland hosted. An integral member of the formidable bowling unit which served Ireland so well, Mooney took eight wickets at 25.12 (including 3-10 against Uganda) as Ireland claimed the runners-up position and consequent qualification for the 2007 Cricket World Cup. Mooney has been named in the Irish squad which will challenge Pakistan, Zimbabwe, and the West Indian hosts in Group D of the competition. As of September 2006, he has appeared in one ODI against England. On 20 April 2007, after Ireland's campaign in the 2007 World Cup, where he played one match in the tournament and the team qualified for the super eights, Mooney announced his retirement from cricket at the age of 30. Looking back at his career for Ireland, he said \""I have been fortunate to have represented Ireland for ten years now, and during that period I have had some of the best times and experiences of my life\"". From 2008-10, he was the head coach of a cricket club in Christchurch, New Zealand."

In the anime and manga, Sakura is a kunoichi affiliated with the village of the Hidden Leaf (Konohagakure), and apart of Team 7, which consists of herself, Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, and their sensei Kakashi Hatake. Sakura initially has an infatuation for Sasuke, praising him at every juncture, and heaped scorn upon the less skilled teammate Naruto. Over the course of the series, she begins to shed this singularly driven persona, and grows more appreciative and accepting of Naruto. Sakura has appeared in several pieces of Naruto media, including nine featured films in the series, all the original video animations, and several video games. Sakura has become the series' female lead, although, she was not immediately intended for the role. Kishimoto has had difficulty drawing her character resulting in Kishimoto inadvertently emphasizing certain parts of her appearance, including her large forehead. Chie Nakamura voices the character in the animated adaptations of the series, while Kate Higgins plays her in the English dub. Numerous anime and manga publications have praised and criticized Sakura's character. She was initially noted to be a stereotypical shōnen character, serving as a love interest for the protagonist, and served little purpose in the series initially beyond being comic relief. Her emergence from this stereotype as the series progressed has been celebrated by many reviewers. Amongst the Naruto reader base, Sakura has been popular, placing high in some polls. Several pieces of merchandise have been released in Sakura's likeness, such as a plush doll and key chains."

He is sometimes referred to as Isaac the Dalmatian, not because he came from Dalmatia, but because of the monastery which he founded. According to some accounts, Isaac was a Syrian, but this is uncertain. Neither is anything known for certain about his early life. But history records that Isaac had been a hermit living in a small hut in the wilderness outside of Constantinople. In the year 378, when he heard that the Roman emperor Valens had fallen into the heresy of Arianism and was persecuting the Nicene Christians, deposing bishops, closing some churches, and turning others over to the Arians, Isaac went into the imperial city to confront the emperor. At the time, Valens was preparing a military campaign against the Goths. After several attempts to dissuade the emperor from his persecutions, Isaac prophesied that Valens would \""die in flames\"" because of his actions. The emperor ordered that Isaac be thrown into prison, vowing that he would punish Isaac and put him to death upon his return from battle. Soon after, on August 9, 378, Valens was defeated at the Battle of Adrianople and died in a fire after taking refuge in a barn. Valens' successor, the Emperor Theodosius I, released Isaac, outlawed Arianism and reopened the churches closed by Valens. Isaac wanted to return to monastic life in the wilderness, but a wealthy aristocrat named Saturninus built a monastery for Isaac in Constantinople, over which he became the first hegumen (abbot). Isaac is also known as a zealous defender of Christian orthodoxy at the Second Ecumenical Council, convened in Constantinople in 381. At the end of his life, Isaac entrusted the leadership of the monastery to his closest disciple, Dalmatus, who was later himself glorified (canonized as a saint), and after whom the monastery came to be known as the Dalmatian Monastery. Isaac died in his monastery on May 30, 383, although others place his death around 396. The life of John Chrysostom includes mention of St. Isaac living into the fifth century. Both the Orthodox and the Catholic churches have glorified Isaac as a saint . Among the former, his feast day falls on May 30, and he is also commemorated together with other saints from his monastery on August 3. Peter the Great of Russia (reigned 1682-1725), whose birthday fell on Saint Isaac's feast day, May 30, adopted Isaac as the patron saint of the Romanov dynasty. Saint Isaac's Cathedral in the city of St Petersburg is consecrated to his honour."

Karen is portrayed by actress Michele Lee, and has appeared on the show since its pilot episode, first broadcast on December 27, 1979. Knots Landing follows the trials of four middle-class families living on a suburban cul-de-sac known as Seaview Circle in California. Lee portrayed Karen for the entire run of Knots Landing, being the sole cast member to appear in every episode of its fourteen seasons. At the time, her appearances in all 344 episodes set a record for an actress on American primetime television. Karen's storylines focus on family troubles, addiction and kidnapping. In her early years on the serial, the character had much more of an \""edge\"" in order to test the audience on who would be the most like J. R. Ewing (Larry Hagman), the primary character of its parent series Dallas. (The bad girl role would later be taken on by Abby Cunningham, Karen's sister-in-law.) Over time, she became much more of a wholesome character. Series creator David Jacobs said \""Karen is the tent pole. She says the things I want to say. She's the voice of the viewer.\"" Entertainment Weekly also described Karen as being \""efficient, kind, and understanding\"". During the course of her existence on the program, she was married to both Sid Fairgate (Don Murray) and second husband Mack MacKenzie (Kevin Dobson). Many other characters would try to undermine her relationship with Mack, such as his daughter, Paige Matheson (Nicollette Sheridan), and former love interest Anne Matheson (Michelle Phillips), though she learned to accept Paige as his daughter later on. Due to her long-running tenure, television personality Joan Rivers commented that Lee was, in theory, the \""First Lady of Knots Landing\"" during her guest appearance on The Late Show, which Rivers hosted at the time. The characters of the serial often represented what was happening in society at the time. Lee acknowledged that, saying: \""Karen wanted to be a Pollyanna and wasn't ashamed of that. Remember in our society, maybe people don't remember, but remember when we could go over to other people's houses and come in through an open back door? I remember when I was a little girl and my mother and father would have people over and they'd walk into an unlocked door in our house.\"""

9,34,"Albrecht Gaiswinkler (October 29, 1905 – May 11, 1979) was an Austrian civil servant, social democrat (SPÖ) politician and resistance fighter, who, some believe, saved the Mona Lisa from destruction in an Austrian salt mine towards the end of World War II. Gaiswinkler was born in Bad Aussee, Austria. In 1934, he was a political prisoner for some months. In 1944, while serving with the German Wehrmacht in France, he deserted and joined the Maquis, bringing with him four trucks of arms and ammunition and 500,000 francs. When the U.S. Third Army liberated Alsace in September 1944, he gave himself up to them (along with 17 German prisoners). He then went to work for the British Special Operations Executive and, in 1945, he was parachuted back into the Aussee area with three colleagues: Valentin Tarra, Johann Moser and Hans Renner. The Germans had pillaged a huge number of European art treasures during the Nazi period, and many had been stored in the Altaussee salt mine near Gaiswinkler's home town of Bad Aussee. After being dropped into the local area, Gaiswinkler raised a force of around 300 men and armed them with captured German weapons. He spent the last weeks and months of the war harassing local German forces. When the Americans arrived, his information helped them capture several eminent Nazis. He and his colleagues had captured the salt mine, prevented the destruction of the artworks held there and were able to hand over \""a number of Nazi treasure hoards, including the Mona Lisa and the Austrian Imperial Crown Jewels\"". Other artworks rescued included the Ghent Altarpiece. The administrators of the Louvre have stated that the Mona Lisa was kept in France during the Second World War, but that it is possible that a 15th- or 16th-century copy of the Mona Lisa was held in Austria. After the war, Gaiswinkler was a SPÖ member of the Austrian Parliament from 1945 to 1949. He died in Bad Aussee in 1979."

2,63,"The 1973 Kansas City Chiefs season ended with a 7–5–2 record and third-place finish in the AFC West. For 1973, the defense kept the club in contention thanks to a nucleus that still included the bulk of the squad’s Super Bowl IV starters. Quarterback Mike Livingston started in a 23–13 Opening Day loss against the Los Angeles Rams on September 16, but Len Dawson returned to rally the club for three consecutive wins to get the club off to a 3–1 start for a third consecutive year. The aging Len Dawson made his final start of the year in a 23–14 loss at Buffalo on October 29 and was replaced for the remainder of the year by Livingston, beginning a string of three straight seasons in which both players split time at the position. Livingston led the club to another three straight wins, putting the team in first place in mid-November with a 6–3–1 record. A 1–2–1 ledger over the season’s final month ended the club’s post-season aspirations as the team finished the year in a second-place tie with Denver at 7–5–2. Len Dawson became the second Chiefs player in as many years to win the NFL Man of the Year Award.

1,48,"The Sack of Amorium by the Abbasid Caliphate in mid-August 838 was one of the major events in the long history of the Arab–Byzantine Wars. The Abbasid campaign was led personally by the Caliph al-Mu'tasim (reigned 833–842), in retaliation to a virtually unopposed expedition launched by the Byzantine emperor Theophilos (r. 829–842) into the Caliphate's borderlands the previous year. Mu'tasim targeted Amorium, a Byzantine city in western Asia Minor (modern Anatolia), because it was the birthplace of the ruling Byzantine dynasty and, at the time, one of Byzantium's largest and most important cities. The caliph gathered an exceptionally large army, which he divided in two parts, which invaded from the northeast and the south. The northeastern army defeated the Byzantine forces under Theophilos at Anzen, allowing the Abbasids to penetrate deep into Byzantine-held Asia Minor and converge upon Ancyra, which they found abandoned. After sacking the city, they turned south to Amorium, where they arrived on 1 August. Faced with intrigues at Constantinople and the rebellion of the large Khurramite contingent of his army, Theophilos was unable to aid the city. Amorium was strongly fortified and garrisoned, but a traitor revealed a weak spot in the wall, where the Abbasids concentrated their attack, effecting a breach. Unable to break through the besieging army, Boiditzes, the commander of the breached section privately attempted to negotiate with the Caliph without notifying his superiors. He concluded a local truce and left his post, which allowed the Arabs to take advantage, enter the city and capture it. Amorium was systematically destroyed, never to recover its former prosperity. Many of its inhabitants were slaughtered, and the remainder driven off as slaves. Most of the survivors were released after a truce in 841, but prominent officials were taken to the caliph's capital of Samarra and executed years later after refusing to convert to Islam, becoming known as the 42 Martyrs of Amorium. The conquest of Amorium was not only a major military disaster and a heavy personal blow for Theophilos, but also a traumatic event for the Byzantines, its impact resonating in later literature. The sack did not ultimately alter the balance of power, which was slowly shifting in Byzantium's favour, but it thoroughly discredited the theological doctrine of Iconoclasm, ardently supported by Theophilos. As Iconoclasm relied heavily on military success for its legitimization, the fall of Amorium contributed decisively to its abandonment shortly after Theophilos's death in 842."

9,46,"Regal Zonophone Records was a British record label formed in 1932, through a merger of the Regal and Zonophone labels. This followed the merger of those labels' respective parent companies – the Columbia Graphophone Company and the Gramophone Company – to form EMI. At the merger, those records from the Regal Records catalogue were prefixed 'MR' and those from the Zonophone Records catalogue were prefixed 'T'. Record releases after the merger continued using only the 'MR' prefix. Originally Regal Zonophone handled American releases from Okeh Records, Victor Records and Columbia Records, as well as offering home-grown recordings by artists such as Gracie Fields and George Formby. The label is also known for its releases of Salvation Army (particularly brass band) music. In the 1950s the Australian division of Regal Zonophone played an important role in the emerging Australian country music genre, signing several emerging country stars including Slim Dusty, Smoky Dawson, Reg Lindsay and Chad Morgan. Slim Dusty's 1957 Regal Zonophone hit \""A Pub with No Beer\"" became the biggest-selling Australian recording ever released up to that time. EMI revived the Regal Zonophone imprint in 1967 to handle the Essex Music/Straight Ahead producing account that had moved from Deram (after one Procol Harum single and two singles by the Move) and continued well into the early 1970s, with successful producers Denny Cordell and Tony Visconti both having production companies releasing records through the label. During this period the label had both album and single success with artists such as the Move, Joe Cocker, Tyrannosaurus Rex and Procol Harum. During the mid-1970s, many of these production deals ended and, despite a few sporadic releases by Blue Mink, Geordie, Dave Edmunds, and Grunt Futtock (a one-off project featuring Roy Wood, Steve Marriott, Peter Frampton and Andy Bown), eventually EMI ceased to use the imprint as a major pop label. Many of the label's artists moved to Fly Records or to the EMI imprint. Regal Zonophone was revived at the end of the 1990s as a reissue label curated by the UK band Saint Etienne. This incarnation of the label is no longer active, as EMI relaunched Regal and Zonophone as separate imprints of Parlophone. In 2013, both Regal and Zonophone were taken over by Warner Music Group after Universal Music Group spun off Parlophone from EMI, at the request of international regulators."

Her father had been told by an oracle that he would be overthrown by his grandson. She secreted the baby in the temple of Athena. A scarcity of grain alerted Aleus that there was a profanation of the temple, and he discovered the child. In one version the baby was exposed on Mount Parthenion above Tegea, where Telephus was suckled by a deer. In another version Auge was given to Nauplius (\""sailor\"") who was to kill her, but who, taking pity, brought her to Teuthras, a king in Mysia, in Asia Minor. Alternatively, Auge and Telephus were put in a crate and set adrift on the sea. They washed up in Mysia, where Telephus later appeared in his wanderings; mother and son were about to consummate their marriage when they were parted by a thunderbolt. In the time of Pausanias (2nd century CE), the tomb of Auge was still shown at Pergamon, where the Attalids venerated Telephus as a founding hero. In the Telephus frieze on the Great Altar of Pergamon, Auge appears in a subsidiary role."

8,57,"Uperoleia is a genus of frogs, native to Australia in the family Myobatrachidae. These are small squat frogs, more commonly known as \""toadlets\"". They have glandular skin, often with a pair of raised glands behind each eye, or on the flanks. They have bumpy, rough skin giving them the appearance of a small toad, hence the name \""toadlet\"", although they are often called \""gungans\"" in Queensland. There are two distinct types of calls - Uperoleia species make either a \""click\"" or a \""squelch\"". Generally, the \""clicking\"" Uperoleia have long thin inguinal glands that run along the dorsal surface, while the \""squelching\"" Uperoleia have round inguinal glands restricted to the posterior half of the dorsal surface. It is unusual to find more than one species of \""clickers\"" or \""squelchers\"" in the same location, although finding one of each is quite frequent in northern Australia. The species in this genus show great similarities in body shape and colouration making them difficult to tell apart. Call analysis is often required to confirm identification. This genus is the largest of any in the Myobatrachidae family. Clicking Uperoleia include U. glandulosa, U. aspera, U. minima, U. trachyderma, U. lithomoda, U. littlejohni, U. altissima, U. mimula, and U. rugosa. The squelching Uperoleia include U. russelli, U. saxatilis, U. talpa, U. borealis, U. crassa, and U. inundata.

Hi Records' first big hit was \""Smokie Part 2\"", an instrumental by Bill Black's Combo in 1959. Black was a bass player with Elvis Presley and a long-time friend of Ray Harris. Founder Claunch was forced out of the label, selling his share in 1960 to Carl McVoy (a cousin of Jerry Lee Lewis), who had been involved with the label since its first recording and had worked with Bill Black. Willie Mitchell joined the label that year as a recording artist. He later went on to produce Al Green in 1968. Bill Black's saxophonist, Ace Cannon, landed a hit with the single \""Tuff\"" in 1961. Hi Records' commercial peak was in the 1960s and 1970s, widely due to the innovative and highly successful work of Al Green. Other artists on the label, including O. V. Wright and Ann Peebles, did not reach the same level of success. In 1970, when founder Joe Cuoghi died and Ray Harris retired, Nick Pesce became president and Willie Mitchell was made vice-president. The label's music was mostly recorded at Willie Mitchell's Royal Studios, located in a renovated movie theater in South Memphis. The label was distributed nationally by London Records. The label used a house backing band of local session musicians, known as the Hi Rhythm Section, on its numerous hit recordings of the 1970s. The popularity of disco music in the late 1970s led to an eventual decline in the popularity of the label's Memphis soul style. In 1977, Pesce sold the label to Cream Records owned by Al Bennett. The label was operated by his daughter, Adalah Bennett Shaw, from 1989 until her death in 2008. Licensed distribution is by Crimson Productions in Europe; EMI licensed the catalog in Canada and the United States until 2009, when Fat Possum Records began distributing for the United States, Canada and Australia.

4,11,"Twin Beds is a 1914 comedic play by Salisbury Field and Margaret Mayo, based on Field's 1913 novel of the same name, which played on Broadway and was also the basis for multiple film adaptations. The play debuted on August 14, 1914, at the Fulton Theatre, and ran on Broadway for 411 performances. The play was not immediately a success upon release despite getting positive reviews, perhaps due to the start of World War I. Producer William Harris Jr. then engaged in a wild marketing scheme where trucks with big ads for the show, pulled by horses, would \""break down\"" at busy intersections. Soon the show was playing to packed houses. Prior to opening, there was a brief controversy over alleged similarities between the play and the play Apartment 12 K which had been rushed to opening to beat it. Though the plays have a similar opening gambit, they were not the same, and Apartment 12 K only had a short unsuccessful run. Four warmup performances of Twin Beds the week before opening on Broadway were done at the Savoy Theatre in Asbury Park, New Jersey. By June 1915, the play shifted from the Fulton Theatre to the Harris Theatre, where it completed its 411-performance run. Irene Haisman replaced Madge Kennedy and Reginald Denny replaced John Westley for the Harris run. Multiple companies embarked on road tours around August 1915. The Oxford Companion to American Theatre describes the play as \""one of the era's most popular comedies.\"""

1,48,"The Battle of Aussig (German: Schlacht bei Aussig) or Battle of Ústí nad Labem (Czech: Bitva u Ústí nad Labem) was fought on 16 June 1426, between Roman Catholic crusaders and the Hussites during the Fourth Crusade of the Hussite Wars. It was fought near Aussig (Ústí nad Labem) in northern Bohemia. The crusade was called because the Pope believed that the Hussite armies would be easily defeated after the death of Jan Žižka. The overall commander of the Hussite forces at the battle was Sigismund Korybut, while Prokop the Great was independently in command of the Taborites. Boso of Vitzthum was the leader of the crusading army. Medieval chronicles states that Hussites had 24,000 soldiers and at least 500 war wagons, while the crusaders had 70,000 men. However modern historians suggest that these numbers are largely exaggerated. The Hussites drew up their Wagenburg on one of the hills near the town. A crusader cavalry assault on the wagon fortress began the battle. The knights could have been equipped with very large battle axes or hammers because one account of the battle has them hewing through the retaining chains on the wagons to breach through the fortress and get inside the Wagenburg. Then, the knights broke through a second defensive line that was made up of pavises. This was the highest point of crusader morale in the whole battle. The Hussite cavalry inside the Wagenburg had left and attacked the knights trying to breach the wagon chains from the rear. The knights were then surrounded and fell under a huge barrage of artillery, crossbow, and handgun fire. The Hussites then charged in on the knights and showed no mercy. The actual battle was brief, and for that reason, it is possible that no more than 4,000 soldiers were lost on the crusader side. However, after the battle, many of the crusaders fled to nearby villages."

8,57,"The Kaup's arrowtooth eel (Synaphobranchus kaupii, also known as the Kaup's cut-throat eel, the Gray's cutthroat, the Longnosed eel, the Northern cutthroat eel, or the Slatjaw cutthroat eel) is an eel in the family Synaphobranchidae (cutthroat eels). It was described by James Yate Johnson in 1862. It is a marine, deep water-dwelling eel which is known from the Indo-Western Pacific and eastern and western Atlantic Ocean, including the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Cape Verde, the Western Sahara, Nigeria, Namibia, South Africa, Greenland, France, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Philippines, Portugal, Spain, the Bahamas, Brazil, Canada, Cuba, Japan, Australia, Mauritania, Morocco, and Hawaii. It dwells at a depth range of 120 to 4,800 metres (390 to 15,750 ft), most often between 400 to 2,200 metres (1,300 to 7,200 ft), and inhabits the upper abyssal zone on the continental slope. It is intolerant of the temperatures of higher waters. Males can reach a maximum total length of 100 centimetres (39 in). The common name and species epithet \""kaupii\"" refer to naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup. The Kaup's arrowtooth eel is preyed on by Coryphaenoides rupestris. Its own diet consists of benthic crustaceans including decapods and amphipods, planktonic crustaceans including euphausiids and mysids, cephalopods including species of Rossia, and bony fish including Macroramphosus scolopax. It is of no commercial interest to fisheries, but it is sometimes caught as by-catch by bottom longline and baited fish traps. Due to the widespread distribution of the species and its abundance in many regions, the IUCN redlist currently lists the Kaup's arrowtooth eel as Least Concern."

7,9,"The Ohiopyle Low Bridge is a structure that carries the Great Allegheny Passage trail across the Youghiogheny River in Ohiopyle, Pennsylvania. The span was originally opened in 1912 as part of the last major railroad constructed in Pennsylvania. It served the Western Maryland Railway's expansion from Cumberland, Maryland to Connellsville, Pennsylvania and was one of two bridges to cross a meandering section of the Yough in Ohiopyle. The original deck girder bridge was located near the center of the tiny community of Ohiopyle and opened the rugged region to tourism. By the 1960s, the importance of the Low Bridge had been dramatically reduced. The automobile had replaced the train as the method of transportation to what was now Ohiopyle State Park, and the narrow clearance of Pennsylvania Route 381's passage under the bridge would lead to bottlenecks during the summer tourism season. The Western Maryland Railway was incorporated into the Chessie System holding company and saw traffic greatly reduced on ancillary lines; in 1975, all service west of Hancock, Maryland was eliminated. Following the closure of the line, a portion of the old bridge was removed to allow for better truck access along PA 381, while the remainder of the structure sat vacant until its incorporation into the Great Allegheny Passage. In 1999, a new bowstring truss bridge was opened on the existing piers of its predecessor. The new bridge is the longest of its type in Pennsylvania."

7,28,"The Caniapiscau River (French: rivière Caniapiscau) is a tributary of the Koksoak River in Nunavik, Quebec, Canada. In Cree the name of the river means rocky point. Starting from Lac Sevestre (53 km (33 mi) south-west from Fermont) on the Canadian Shield, the Caniapiscau River flows northward through a wide, timbered glacial valley until it makes a sharp turn at its confluence with the Rivière aux Mélèzes (Larch River). At this point (called Kanniq Confluence), the river becomes the Koksoak River. The total length of the Caniapiscau River is 737 kilometres (458 mi). Since 1985, the headwaters of the Caniapiscau River have been diverted into the La Grande hydroelectric complex.

Important variations in the water flow of the Caniapiscau River from 1981 to 1984, during the period when the Caniapiscau Reservoir was being filled, may have contributed to the death by drowning of 9,600 migratory woodland caribou in September 1984 at Chute du Calcaire (about 1,5% of George River herd).

9,20,"Head of Femur is a Chicago band formed in November 2001 by Nebraska natives Mike Elsener, Ben Armstrong and Matt Focht. The band was initially conceived as a forum for the three to compose pop songs while awaiting the reformation of their previous band, Pablo's Triangle. As the weeks passed the reformation looked unlikely. With a large catalog of songs already taking shape by early 2002, Head of Femur began to recruit musicians to flesh out the lineup for live performance. The nature of the music demanded more than the traditional rock band instrumentation, so strings, trumpet, and orchestral percussion were added along with drums and bass guitar. Head of Femur played their first show at a small club in Chicago in March 2002. They made plans to record a demo with local producer Jim Bentley and perform at Chicago's The Empty Bottle. On the strength of that demo, Portland's Greyday Productions signed Head of Femur in November 2002. Recording sessions for the band's debut album, Ringodom or Proctor, took place in March 2003. Ten of Ringodom's eleven songs were among the first of the dozens composed by Elsener, Armstrong and Focht, and had been intended to comprise the first record since their inception. The album was recorded at Lincoln, Nebraska's Presto! Recording Studios with A. J. Mogis. Following more than a year of touring as an 8-piece (2 guitars, trumpet, trombone, violin, drums, keys, 4 vocals and percussion) with such acts as Bright Eyes and Rilo Kiley, as well as outings on their own, Head of Femur signed with Brooklyn's spinART Records in the summer of 2004. In August 2004, Head of Femur set about recording their next full-length record. Hysterical Stars was recorded at Wall To Wall in Chicago with engineers Chris Brickley and Dan Dietrich and released in late May 2005. Head Of Femur spent 2005 touring with Architecture in Helsinki, Wilco, Dr. Dog, The Spinto Band, The Bruces, Andrew Bird, Matt Pond PA and headlining tours themselves. They were the first band on the first Intonation Music Festival and performed at the Wicker Park Festival, CMJ and SXSW. During a short break from touring in the Fall of 2005, the group laid down four tracks mostly live at Truckstop Studios in Chicago. The recordings showcased a more band-oriented sound as opposed to the multi-tracked orchestra captured on their first two albums. The songs, including covers from The Band and Neil Young and Crazy Horse were released in late 2005 as an iTunes exclusive EP. Head Of Femur finished up the year by stripping the lineup down to a more traditional five-piece lineup of the core trio plus Nick \""The Chancellor\"" Westra on bass/vocals and Tyson Thurston on keys. This lineup played two shows on New Year's Eve in Chicago. As of May 2007, Head of Femur had completed work on their third full-length, \""Great Plains\"", due to be released March 25, 2008."

Of the three Gorgons, she was known to be the most independent and ferocious, having killed more men than both of her sisters combined. In Greek mythology, she was transformed into a Gorgon because of standing with her sister Medusa, who was raped by the sea god Poseidon in the Temple of Athena. Athena bearing no emotion and finding no fault in Poseidon, was furious with Medusa. As a punishment, Medusa was changed into a terrible monster, along with her sisters Stheno and Euryale. Stheno tends to be depicted as a thin gorgon monster with red snakes curling around her head instead of hair, however earlier accounts describe her as having a scaly head, a boar's tusks, bronzed hands, a protruding tongue, glaring eyes and a snake around the waist as a belt.

Solvorn was a natural place to go to for all the people who lived around the lake Hafslovatnet and its surrounding villages when they would sell or buy anything. The village had its heyday when the fjord was the main thoroughfare for transportation for the region. Since that time, car transportation has become more important that fjord travel, and the Norwegian County Road 55 was built on the other side of the mountains, closer to Hafslo, so Solvorn is no longer located along the main transportation route. Solvorn received a post office in 1841 and had that post office until 1995 when it was closed."

8,57,"Beewolves (genus Philanthus), also known as bee-hunters or bee-killer wasps, are solitary, predatory wasps, most of which prey on bees, hence their common name. The adult females dig tunnels in the ground for nesting, while the territorial males mark twigs and other objects with pheromones to claim the territory from competing males. As with all other sphecoid wasps the larvae are carnivorous, forcing the inseminated females to hunt for other invertebrates (in this case bees), on which she lays her eggs, supplying the larvae with prey when they emerge. The adults consume nectar from flowers. The prevalent European species, P. triangulum, specializes in preying upon honey bees, thus making it a minor pest for beekeepers. Other Philanthus may specialize in other bee species or they may be generalists which prey upon a wide variety of bees such as the American bumblebee, Bombus pensylvanicus,or other hymenopterans. They are notable in stinging their prey in a membranous location on the ventral surface where the venom quickly paralyzes major voluntary muscles, yet does not kill the prey. The prey may attempt to sting in return, but it is always grabbed in such a way that only well-armored portions of the beewolf's body are presented. The beewolf carries the prey back to a tunnel, but usually only stores it temporarily, until it is later used to provision a cell burrow, where an egg is laid. The tunnel of Philanthus triangulum can be as much as 1 m long. The first part of the tunnel slopes downward at an angle of 30° after which it levels out. Up to 34 lateral tunnels each ending in a brood chamber branch off from the main tunnel. Each brood chamber is stocked with one to six honeybees."

9,47,"Photisarath (also spelled Phothisarath, Phothisarat, or Potisarat) (1501–1547) son of King Visoun of Lanxang, is considered to be the most devout of the Lao kings. He banned spirit worship and built temples upon the sites of spirit shrines. His elephant fell and crushed him while he sought to display his prowess to the diplomatic corps. His son Setthathirath returned from Chiang Mai to succeed him to the throne of Lan Xang. Phothisarath was ruler (1520–47) of the Lao kingdom of Lan Xang whose territorial expansion embroiled Laos in the warfare that swept mainland Southeast Asia in the latter half of the 16th century. King Chairachathirat of the Ayutthaya Kingdom invaded Vientiane with a large army in 1540, captured Muang Khouk and crossed the Mekong, but succumbed to a rout at the battle of Sala Kham, the remnants fleeing for their lives and leaving enormous casualties behind. Phothisarath himself allied himself with Burma, sent out 3 campaigns against the Ayutthaya Kingdom: the first to Phitsanulok in 1535, the second one to Vieng Prangarm in 1539, and third was sent in 1548 to Vieng Prab (now Sawangaburi) where he brought back 20,000 families to settle in the Lan Xang kingdom. In 1548, following the ascension of King Maha Chakkraphat and queen Suriyothai to the Ayutthaya Kingdom throne, Burmese king Tabinshwehti planned an attack, starting the Burmese–Siamese War. Tabinshwehti asked Phothisarath to attack Ayutthaya from the North which eventually resulted in the famous death of Suriyothai in defense of her husband. Phothisarath was a pious Buddhist who worked to undermine animism and Brahmanic religious practices and promote Buddhism. In 1527, Phothisarath issued a decree proscribing the worship of animism as groundless superstition, and ordering their shrines to be destroyed and their altars thrown into the river. He resided much of the time not in the capital at Luang Prabang but in Vientiane, which was located farther south and maintained better communications with the major states of the region. Phothisarath married a princess from Chiang Mai (now part of northern Thailand), and when his father-in-law Mueangketklao, the ruler of Lan Na or Chiang Mai, died in 1546 without male issue, Phothisarath's own son Setthathirath placed on the Chiang Mai throne. When Phothisarath died the following year, after a fatal accident while hunting wild elephants, Setthathirath succeeded him and joined together the two kingdoms—which were soon embroiled in Burmese–Siamese wars that would devastate much of the region over the next half-century."

3,4,"Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U.S. ___ (2012), is a Supreme Court of the United States decision in which the Court held that a dispute over the regulation of passports was not a political question and thus resolvable by the courts. Specifically, Zivotofsky's parents sought to have his passport read \""Jerusalem, Israel\"", rather than \""Jerusalem\"", as his place of birth. The State Department had rejected that request under a longstanding policy that took no stance on the legal status of Jerusalem. The Court said that Zivotofsky could test the constitutionality of a Congressional law that ordered the Secretary of State to list people born in Jerusalem as born in Israel. This action was taken over the objections of the State Department, which insisted that issues of foreign policy were inherently political and thus not justiciable by the Courts. On remand, the Court of Appeals held in July 2013 that the law was an unconstitutional infringement of the President's recognition powers. On April 21, 2014, the Supreme Court granted the Zivotofskys' petition for certiorari, in Zivotofsky v. Kerry.

The Battle of Cambrai was an all-important battle not only because it was an effort by the allied forces to break the Hindenburg Line of the Germans, but also because it was there that tanks were used successfully for the first time in the history of warfare. On the night of 30 November and 1 December 1917 east of Pezières, France, Lance-Dafadar Gobind Singh was in the midst of the Battle of Cambrai, when his regiment was cut off and surrounded by enemy.

He was the eldest son of John Arthur Brooke and Blanche Weston, and went to school at Repton. In 1898, he joined the Yorkshire Dragoons, a Yeomanry unit, and served with the Imperial Yeomanry in the Second Boer War. He was promoted to lieutenant in the Imperial Yeomanry on 10 March 1900. An act of gallantry in the field won him a commission as second lieutenant in the 7th Hussars of the regular British Army, on the recommendation of Field Marshal (United Kingdom) the Lord Roberts, the commission was dated 3 October 1900, and in November 1900 he returned to England and joined the unit at Aldershot. In 1902, Brooke resigned from the army and returned to England. There he met and worked with Major Frederick Russell Burnham, the famous American scout and then a Director of the East African Syndicate. In April 1903, as part of the Syndicate, Brooke left England for East Africa and went on an expedition with John C. Blick, Mr. Bittlebank, and Mr. Brown. The party, known as the \""Four B.'s\"", traveled from Nairobi via Mount Elgon northwards to the western shores of Lake Rudolph, experiencing plenty of privations from want of water, and of the danger from encounters with the natives. Brooke returned to England in April 1904 and applied himself to the study of scientific objects. He received his diploma for survey from the Royal Geographic Society and was made a Fellow of the Society. In March 1906, Brooke went to India to organize an expedition to Tibet to investigate the much debated question of the relation of the Yarlung Tsangpo (then called the Sampo) and Brahmaputra Rivers. Because of a treaty between Russia and the government of India, Brooke's party had to enter Tibet from the North, and this meant travelling via Hankow, Singan, Pingliang, Lanchow, to Siningu, where the party collected ponies, yaks, and supplies. In October 1906, the 13th Dalai Lama (Thubten Gyatso) arrived from Urgu, and Mr. Brooke obtained an audience to see him, the first for an Englishman. During this audience, Brooke was given permission to enter into Tibet. Brooke crossed Tibet and returned to Shanghai in October 1907. He left Shanghai for a second expedition in December 1907 and travelled in Western Sechuan and Eastern Tibet until 24 December 1908, when he was cruelly murdered in the Independent Lolo Land (Yi people)."

8,57,"Lysmata is a genus of shrimp in the infraorder Caridea, the caridean shrimp. The genus now belongs to the family Hippolytidae, but recent cladistic analysis suggests it should be included in its former family, Lysmatidae. Lysmata are popular ornamental shrimp in the marine aquarium trade for their bright color patterns, interesting behaviors, and ability to control certain aquarium pests such as sea anemones of the genus Aiptasia. They are known to command high prices on the pet market. The genus is informally divided into two main categories. Some species are cleaner shrimp which \""clean\"" parasites and other material from fish, live in pairs, and are brightly colored, often in contrasting reds and yellows with white antennae. Other species are the \""peppermint shrimp\"", which have semi-translucent, red-banded bodies, and live in large groups. Some peppermint shrimp perform cleaning behaviors, but less actively than do the cleaner shrimp. The genus has been studied with interest due to its unusual sexual system, protandric simultaneous hermaphroditism. While some other taxa of shrimp undergo sequential hermaphroditism, they have only been observed changing from male to female. In Lysmata, males become true hermaphrodites instead of females. So far, every species studied has been confirmed to have this sexual system. During their \""female phase\"" they actually have functioning male and female tissues in their gonads and produce both types of gamete. When paired, they take turns fertilizing each other's eggs. Lysmata occur in the tropics and in warmer temperate waters. They usually live on rock and coral reefs, in shallow and deeper areas. Some live in sponges."
4,11,"Green Grow the Lilacs is a 1930 play by Lynn Riggs named for the popular folk song of the same name. It was performed 64 times on Broadway, opening on January 26, 1931 and closing March 21, 1931. It also played January 19, 1931 through January 24, 1931 at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C. It was produced by the Theatre Guild and directed by Herbert J. Biberman. Rather startlingly, the debonair, ultrasophisticated actor Franchot Tone portrayed cowboy Curly. June Walker was seen as his sweetheart Laurey. Tex Ritter sang four songs in the role of Cord Elam and was understudy for the lead part as Curly, though he never had occasion to perform in that role. Theatre Guild board member Helen Westley, who had appeared as Mrs. Muskat in the original Broadway production of Ferenc Molnár's Liliom, played Aunt Eller. Lee Strasberg, later to become a renowned teacher of method acting, played the part of the Syrian peddler.The play also toured the Midwest, and was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. It appeared at the Dallas Little Theatre during the week of March 7, 1932, and again in Dallas at the Festival of Southwestern Plays, on May 10, 1935. Although the 1943 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical play Oklahoma!, which is based on the Riggs play, used a new score rather than the old folk songs in Riggs' work, the plot of Green Grow The Lilacs is almost identical, except for the ending, which unlike that of the musical, is left rather undecided as to Curly's trial for accidentally killing farmhand Jeeter (renamed Jud Fry in the musical). In addition, the cowboy Will Parker is only referred to in the original Riggs play; he does not actually appear in it. Therefore, the entire comic subplot involving the fifty dollars that Will must obtain in order to be able to marry Ado Annie is an invention of Hammerstein's. Green Grow the Lilacs is today largely forgotten in its original form, while Oklahoma! remains one of the most acclaimed and popular American musicals ever written."
7,23,"The Dent du Géant (It.: Dente del Gigante, \""giant's tooth\"") (4,013 m) is a mountain in the Mont Blanc massif in France and Italy. The Dent du Géant remained unclimbed during the golden age of alpinism, and was a much-coveted peak in the 1870s, repelling many parties who attempted it mostly from the Rochefort ridge. In 1880 the strong team of Albert F. Mummery and Alexander Burgener tried to force a passage via the south-west face but were repelled by a band of slabs, causing Mummery to exclaim 'Absolutely inaccessible by fair means!' The mountain has two summits, 88 feet (27 m) apart and separated by a small col (an 'extremely awkward notch' according to W. W. Graham): \n* Pointe Sella (4,009 m), first ascent via the south-west face by Jean Joseph Maquignaz with son Baptiste Maquignaz and nephew, Daniel Maquignaz on 28 July 1882. Over a period of four days they placed iron stanchions and fixed ropes, enabling the same party to climb Pointe Sella a second time on the following day with clients Alessandro Sella, Alfonso Sella, Corradino Sella and Gaudenzio Sella.  \n* Pointe Graham (4,013 m), first ascent by W. W. Graham with guides Auguste Cupelin and Alphonse Payot on 20 August 1882. They used the fixed ropes of \""Sella's staircase\"" to repeat the ascent of Pointe Sella, where Graham noted that one of the Maquignazes had carved the letter 'M' on a rock step. They then lowered themselves 12 metres (39 ft) into the col to climb this higher north-east peak. This ascent marked the end of the so-called silver age of alpinism. On 28 July 1935 the Austrian climbers Herbert Burggasser and Rudi Leitz first ascended the vertical-to-overhanging 160 m-high south face. It was the first climb in the Western Alps systematically aided by the pitons and artificial techniques that were already in use by climbers in the Eastern Alps. The following huts serve the mountain: \n* Rifugio Torino (3,372 m, CAI, staffed mid May–end September)  \n* Torino hut (3,332 m, CAI, all year) \n* Pointe Hellbronner (3,462 m, téléphérique station which can be used as a base)"

Berry succeeded in entering parliament on his second attempt, defeating Country and Labor Party candidates to win the 1939 Irwin-Moore by-election as an independent. The by-election had been caused by the resignation of Claude Barker, who campaigned on Berry's behalf. Berry retained Irwin-Moore at the 1943 state election, but at the 1947 election was defeated by the Country Party's John Ackland. After leaving parliament, he was re-elected to the Rockingham Road Board, serving as chairman for a period. Berry died in Perth in September 1949."
7,12,"Beaufort or Belfort Castle (Arabic:قلعة الشقيف Qala'at al-Shaqif ) is a Crusader fortress in Nabatieh Governorate, Southern Lebanon, about 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) to the south-south-east of the village of Arnoun. There was a fortification on the site before it was captured by Fulk, King of Jerusalem, in 1139 and construction of the Crusader castle probably began soon after. Saladin captured Beaufort in 1190, but 60 years later Crusaders re-took it. In 1268 Sultan Baibars captured the castle. The castle was named bel fort or beau fort (French for \""beautiful fortress\"") by the Crusaders who occupied the castle in the 12th century. Its Arabic name Qala'at al-Shaqif means \""Castle of the High Rock\"" (shqif is the Aramaic word for \""high rock\""). Beaufort provides one of the few cases where a medieval castle proved of military value and utility also in modern warfare, as its late 20th-century history shows."

In 1945, she established the first mothers' milk bank at Delaware Hospital (now Wilmington Hospital) in Wilmington, Delaware. Handy was born in Smyrna, Delaware and was the daughter of L. Irving Handy, a U.S. Representative. She attended Goucher College and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine from which she graduated in 1916. She was the first native-born female Delawarean to become a doctor and was also the state’s first pediatrician. In 1918, during an outbreak of Spanish influenza in the Wilmington area, Handy was asked by the Board of Health to open a paediatric ward at People's Settlement staffed by volunteers and with very little equipment. She subsequently established a pediatric clinic and became Assistant Chief, and in 1921, Chief, of Pediatrics at Delaware Hospital where she set up a nursery for premature babies. Handy collected surplus breast milk in the community to feed the babies of mothers who could not breast feed, and in 1945 founded the Mother's Milk Bank with Margaret Trentman, a hospital board member whose baby son had died because she was unable to nurse him. The bank supplied breast milk to mothers throughout the United States as well as for research purposes, for 40 years. She also helped to establish ophthalmology as a speciality in Delaware, with Norman Cutler becoming the first state-certified ophthalmologist in 1947. Handy received a number of awards including the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary's Elizabeth Blackwell Citation (honoring female doctors) and the Annie Jump Cannon medal from Wesley College as well as the 1953 Josiah Marvel Cup for outstanding contributions to the state and to society in the field of children's medicine.

Against Kansas in Lawrence in 1958, Parr made perhaps his greatest defensive play. With the final seconds ticking away, Kansas went to Wilt Chamberlain under the basket for an assumed easy lay-in. Parr went straight up and batted the ball away, enabling K-State to take a thrilling 79–75 victory. Three times Parr gained all-league honors. Twice he helped the Wildcats to conference championships and NCAA play and twice received All-America recognition.

8,57,"Not to be confused with the draughtboard shark, Cephaloscyllium laticeps, of Australia. The draughtsboard shark (Cephaloscyllium isabellum) is a species of catshark, and part of the family Scyliorhinidae, so named for its \""checkerboard\"" color pattern of dark blotches. It is endemic to New Zealand, where it is also known as the carpet shark (which usually refers to the entire order Orectolobiformes). This shark typically reaches 1 m (3.3 ft) in length and has a thick body with a broad, flattened head and a capacious mouth. Its two dorsal fins are placed far back on the body, with the first much larger than the second. Occurring down to a depth of 673 m (2,208 ft), the draughtsboard shark frequents rocky reefs during the day and sandy flats at night. Its diet consists of fishes and invertebrates. When threatened by a predator, it can take water or air into its body to inflate its body, which may be the cause of its unusual habit of barking like a dog. This species is oviparous, with females laying smooth, tendril-bearing egg capsules in pairs. Draughtsboard sharks are often taken as bycatch by commercial fisheries, but are probably hardy enough to survive the experience. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern."

8,57,"Oligonychus ununguis, the spruce spider mite, occurs throughout much of Canada and the United States (Rose and Lindquist 1985). Though not particularly important in the forest, it has been bothersome on planted spruce in the Prairie Provinces, and is considered one of the most important pests of spruce plantations in Ontario. As well, ornamental specimens of spruce and most other conifers throughout the range often suffer damage. The pest is barely visible without the aid of a magnifier and is rarely noticed until discoloured foliage is found on an affected tree. To check for the presence of mites, sharply jar suspected foliage over a piece of white paper, and watch for movement of tiny objects. If a red stain appears when the objects are smeared against the paper, the probability is high that spider mites are present. Spruce spider mites suck sap from needles and shoots, causing the foliage to become mottled. The fine silk webbing that they spin as they move about the needles catches dust and further impairs the appearance of the host tree. Mites tend to become particularly numerous and destructive during hot dry seasons. They are readily dispersed by wind and by the distribution of infected nursery stock. The pest overwinters in the egg stage, mostly on the twigs. In the Prairie Provinces, the eggs hatch in May. The young, which to the layperson resemble the adult mite, develop into first generation adults by early June. By mid-June, the female, only about 0.5 mm long, lays 40 to 50 eggs on the foliage. These eggs give rise to a second generation of adult mites in late June, and 3 to 6 generations follow throughout summer and early fall. The overwintering eggs are laid from September to the onset of severe frost."

7,39,"1052 Belgica, provisional designation 1925 VD, is a stony binary asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, about 11 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte at the Royal Observatory of Belgium in Uccle, on 15 November 1925. The S-type asteroid is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.9–2.6 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,221 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.14 and is tilted by 5 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. The body's surface has an albedo of 0.27, according to the NEOWISE mission of the U.S. Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) assumes a somewhat more moderate value of 0.20. In 2012, photometric light-curve observations from several observatories in Italy, the Czech Republic, Spain and the United States rendered a rotation period of 2.7097±0.0001 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.08 in magnitude, indicating a nearly spherical shape for the asteroid. The observations also revealed, that it is a binary system with an asteroid moon, about 36% the diameter of its primary, orbiting it every 47.26±0.02 hours. The minor planet was named in honor of the state of Belgium and the first minor planet to be discovered Royal Observatory of Belgium in Uccle, after which the minor planet 1276 Ucclia was named. The name \""Belgica\"" was suggested during the height of World War I by American astronomer Joel Hastings Metcalf, but the Director of the German Astronomisches Rechen-Institut in Berlin, Fritz Cohn, rejected the proposal based on political considerations, as Belgium was occupied by German troops at the time. In his Dictionary of Minor Planets Names, astronomer Lutz Schmadel describes this piece of history involving minor planet names in detail."

9,49,"The 127th Order of Kutuzov Second Degree Machine-Gun Artillery Division (127 пулемётно-артиллерийская дивизия) was a division of the Russian Ground Forces, which traced its history to the 66th Rifle Division of World War II. The division was originally formed on 14 May 1932 in village Lutkovka-medical in the Veditsky Shmakovsky raion of the Ussuriisk Oblast, Far Eastern Military District, as the 1st or 2nd (sources differ) Collective Farm Division. It was renamed the 66th Rifle Division on 21 May 1936. The division formed part of the 35th Army of the Independent Coastal Group in the Far East in May 1945. In August 1945 the division, as a part of 1st Far East Front, participated in the Soviet operation against Japan. On 9 August 1945 the division began operations as part of 35th Army, advancing 12 kilometers, having forced the Songacha River in northern Heilongjiang. The division fought on the Ussuri River at Khotunsky (Хотунского), Mishansky (Мишаньского), Border (Пограничного), and Duninsky (Дунинского) fortified districts, capturing the cities of Mishan, Jilin, Jantszy, and Harbin. For its valour in combat and courage on 19 September 1945 the 66th Rifle Division was awarded the Order of Kutuzov, Second Degree. Three Hero of the Soviet Union medals, 1266 awards, and 2838 medals were given to the division's personnel. On 29 November 1945 it was reorganised as the 2nd Tank Division, but was renamed again in 1957 as the 32nd Tank Division and in 1965 as the 66th Tank Division. On 30 March 1970 the division became the 277th Motor Rifle Division. In May 1981 the division headquarters was relocated to Sergeevka (Сергеевка). On 1 June 1990 the 277th Motor Rifle Division was reorganised as the 127th Machine Gun Artillery Division. The 702nd Motor Rifle Regiment was disbanded and replaced by the 114th Machine-Gun Artillery Regiment. It incorporated the 114th and 130th Machine Gun Artillery Regiments, the 314th Motor Rifle Regiment, 218th Tank Regiment, 872nd Artillery Regiment, and 1172nd Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment. In mid-2008 the division, under a new commander, Sergey Ryzhkov, replaced some of its former cadre units with higher-readiness units. A regiment arrived from Sergeevka and two regiments of constant readiness from Kamen-Rybolov (438th Motor Rifle Regiment?) on the western shore of Khanka Lake, and Ussuriysk (the 231st Motor Rifle Regiment). These changes effectively made the division a motor rifle formation though its designation was still that of a static defence formation. In 2009, as part of the Russian Ground Forces' transition to brigades, the division appears to have been reorganised as the 59th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade at (Sergeevka, Primorsky Krai), from the main body of the division, equipped with BMPs, and the 60th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade (п. Lipovtsy, Primorsky Krai), from the 218th Tank Regiment of the division, also equipped with BMPs."

9,49,"The traditions of the regiment date back to the Napoleonic Wars and the Duchy of Warsaw. In 1809, a cavalry unit was formed in Podolia, by Colonel Marcin Tarnowski. The unit was later named 16th Uhlan Regiment of the Duchy of Warsaw, and it was garrisoned in Lublin. Currently, traditions of the regiment are continued by the 7th Pomeranian Brigade of Coastal Defence (7. Pomorska Brygada Obrony Wybrzeza). On December 29, 1918, in the town of Lwowek, Provinz Posen, a cavalry unit was formed by Sergeant Wojciech Swierczek. The unit consisted of ethnic Poles from Greater Poland, who had served in the Imperial German Army. On January 5, the unit, commanded by Swierczek, became part of the Greater Poland Army, fighting against Germany in the Greater Poland Uprising (1918–19). In May 1919, the Second Regiment of Greater Poland Uhlans, based on the unit of Sergeant Swierczek, was formed in Biedrusko. On November 18, 1919, in front of the town hall in Poznan, Colonel Paslawski of the regiment received a flag, handed to him by General Jozef Dowbor-Musnicki. The flag featured the Mother of God on one side, and a red cross with a white eagle in the middle on the other side. Buried during World War Two, it is now kept at the Polish Army Museum in Warsaw. On January 24, 1920, the regiment entered Bydgoszcz, to stay there until 1939. It was garrisoned in the barracks located on Szubinska Street. In March 1920, after renaming into 16th Greater Poland Uhlan Regiment, the unit was transported east, to fight in the Polish-Soviet War. It distinguished itself in several battles and clashes. In 1938, the regiment was named after General Gustaw Orlicz-Dreszer. Mobilized in late August 1939, the regiment, commanded by Colonel Julian Arnoldt-Russocki, was ordered to defend the positions in the Tuchola Forest, near Chojnice and Tuchola. After heavy fighting against panzer units of General Heinz Guderian and being bombed by the Luftwaffe, the regiment ceased to exist on September 7. By that time, it had lost 40% of its soldiers. The regiment had its own zurawiejka: “Even though they are drinking straight from the barrel, they are not drunk, the uhlans from Bydgoszcz”."

9,49,"The Sandinista National Liberation Front (Spanish: Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional, FSLN) is now a democratic socialist political party in Nicaragua. Its members are called Sandinistas [sandiˈnistas] in both English and Spanish. The party is named after Augusto César Sandino, who led the Nicaraguan resistance against the United States occupation of Nicaragua in the 1930s. The FSLN overthrew Anastasio Somoza Debayle in 1979, ending the Somoza dynasty, and established a revolutionary government in its place. Following their seizure of power, the Sandinistas ruled Nicaragua from 1979 to 1990, first as part of a Junta of National Reconstruction. Following the resignation of centrist members from this Junta, the FSLN took exclusive power in March 1981. They instituted a policy of mass literacy, devoted significant resources to health care, and promoted gender equality. A militia, known as the Contras was formed in 1981 to overthrow the Sandinista government and was funded and trained by the US Central Intelligence Agency. In 1984 elections were held but were boycotted by some opposition parties. The FSLN won the majority of the votes, and those who opposed the Sandinistas won approximately a third of the seats. The civil war between the Contras and the government continued until 1989. After revising the constitution in 1987 and after years of fighting the Contras the FSLN lost what many consider the first truly democratic election in 1990 to Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, but retained a plurality of seats in the legislature. The FSLN remains one of Nicaragua's two leading parties. The FSLN often polls in opposition to the Constitutionalist Liberal Party, or PLC. In the 2006 Nicaraguan general election, former FSLN President Daniel Ortega was re-elected President of Nicaragua with 38.7% of the vote compared to 29% for his leading rival, bringing in the country's second Sandinista government after 16 years of the opposition winning elections.

It was released by RCA Records in June, 1991 and reached #33 on the Australian singles chart; \""Many people have told me \""1000 Miles Away\"" is their favourite Gurus song and it's also among my top ten. There are references to airports and flying but I was writing about emotional distance rather than physical travel. \""I Think You Know\"" was another Punishment Song. We liked to keep bashing out the last two chords for a couple of minutes, Buzzcocks-style, a bit like a punk mantra. Punishment never felt so good.\""— Dave Faulkner, The crew of Royal Australian Navy frigate HMAS Canberra had an association with the song after they adopted it as their 'anthem'. Hoodoo Gurus played a concert including the Replenishment At Sea song \""1000 Miles Away\"" on-board during their last voyage out of Fremantle to Fleet Base West, prior to its decommissioning in 2005. The single was also released as a limited edition picture disc, on which the B-side is not listed but titled as 4 symbolic drawings: an eye, a light bulb, a horseshoe, and a circle with a line through it (for back cover see below right, when read using the Rebus Principle this becomes \""I Think You Know\""). It was also released as a cassette single with free 'Kinky' Hoodoo Gurus magazine. The B side \""I Think You Know\"" was also written by Faulkner. The second B-side on the CD Maxi-single, \""Stomp the Tumbarumba\"", was originally recorded by New Zealand musician, Johnny Devlin, in 1963. It featured an uncredited appearance by the Gibb brothers (Bee Gees) as backup singers and reached #5 on the Sydney singles charts and #5 on the Brisbane charts the year of its release."

In early 2006, the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation revealed that ERT SAT would be undergoing a major overhaul to allow it to better meet the needs of Greeks abroad. Among the changes are new programmes designed specifically for the Omogeneia (Greek expatriates) and a localized schedule to serve each of the newly designated program 'zones'- North America, Europe/Africa & Asia/Australia.

After the team had returned from its 1991 playoff season with a 4–12 1992 campaign, the Jets and coach Bruce Coslet looked to get back into the postseason. The biggest acquisition for the Jets in the offseason was quarterback Boomer Esiason, whom New York acquired from the Cincinnati Bengals for a draft pick.

7,39,"1588 Descamisada, provisional designation 1951 MH, is an asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt, roughly about 25 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 27 June 1951, by astronomer Miguel Itzigsohn at the La Plata Astronomical Observatory in La Plata, Argentina. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.8–3.2 AU once every 5 years and 3 months (1,925 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.07 and is tilted by 11 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. Little is known about the asteroids size, composition, albedo and rotation, despite having a well-observed orbit with the lowest possible uncertainty – which is denoted by a condition code of 0 – and an observation arc that spans over a period of more than 60 years. With an absolute magnitude of 11.3, the asteroid's diameter could be anywhere between 14 and 36 kilometers for an assumed albedo in the range of 0.05–0.25 (see NASA's conversion table). Since outer main-belt asteroids typically have a spectral type of a darker carbonaceous, rather than a brighter rocky body, its true diameter may be at the upper end of NASA's generic conversion table, as an object's diameter increases, when its albedo decreases, for a given absolute magnitude. The minor planet was named for Eva Perón and its name is a feminized form of \""descamisado\"" (shirtless one) – a term used to denote the working class citizens which formed the support base of Peronism. Eva Perón, also known as \""Evita\"", was the wife of Argentine President Juan Perón, First Lady of Argentina and idolized by millions. The asteroids 1569 Evita, 1581 Abanderada, 1582 Martir and 1589 Fanatica were also discovered by Itzigsohn, and were also given names in tribute to Perón."

In the world of British underground rock, the Greasy Truckers Party ... ... looms about as large as the Monterey International Pop Festival does in American rock lore; it wasn't the biggest gig ever played by the bands involved, but for reasons of exposure, and resulting word-of-mouth, and the excerpted live album that followed, it came to define what they were capable of.— Bruce Eder, Allmusic Greasy Truckers were \""a loose organisation of individuals whose ideals were based on those of the Diggers in San Francisco, recycling money into worthwhile causes.\""  This album was the first of two albums recorded at concerts in London organised by Greasy Truckers, the second being Greasy Truckers Live at Dingwalls Dance Hall (1974).

He was Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), President of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), and leader of the Fatah political party and former paramilitary group, which he founded in 1959. Originally opposed to Israel's existence, he modified his position in 1988 when he accepted UN Security Council Resolution 242. Arafat and his movement operated from several Arab countries. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Fatah faced off with Jordan in a brief civil war. Forced out of Jordan and into Lebanon, Arafat and Fatah were major targets of Israel's 1978 and 1982 invasions of that country. Later in his career, Arafat engaged in a series of negotiations with the government of Israel to end the decades-long conflict between it and the PLO. These included the Madrid Conference of 1991, the 1993 Oslo Accords and the 2000 Camp David Summit. His political rivals, including Islamists and several PLO leftists, often denounced him for being corrupt or too submissive in his concessions to the Israeli government. In 1994 Arafat received the Nobel Peace Prize, together with Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, for the negotiations at Oslo. During this time, Hamas and other militant organizations rose to power and shook the foundations of the authority that Fatah under Arafat had established in the Palestinian territories. In late 2004, after effectively being confined within his Ramallah compound for over two years by the Israeli army, Arafat became ill, fell into a coma and died on 11 November 2004 at the age of 75. While the cause of Arafat's death has remained the subject of speculation, investigations by Russian and French teams determined no foul play was involved. Arafat remains a controversial figure. The majority of the Palestinian people view him as a heroic freedom fighter and martyr who symbolized the national aspirations of his people, while most Israelis came to regard him as an unrepentant terrorist."

In 1198, he proclaimed a union between Rome and the Armenian Church. Gregory VI was a nephew of Gregory III of Cilicia and Nerses IV the Gracious. He was favorable to the Latins and had been nominated by Prince Levon I of Armenia (the future King Levon I), because of the need of an alliance. This election created a schism in the Armenian Church however, and a rival anti-patriarch was elected in Greater Armenia. Gregory's announcement of union was not followed in deeds however, as the local clergy and populace was strongly opposed to it. When Levon, Lord of Cilicia, asked to the Pope and to the Emperor that he be recognized as king, the condition was that the Armenian Church should join the Roman rite. He formally accepted the union, but this again was without effect as the Armenian clergy was strongly opposed to it, and never accepted the doctrine of the double nature of Christ. Gregory VI crowned him King of Armenia in 1198/1199 and the Cilician Armenian kingdom began."

7,9,"The Puente de Occidente (Bridge of the West), so named because it is located in western Antioquia, Colombia, is a suspension bridge that connects the municipalities of Olaya and Santa Fe de Antioquia, east and west of the Cauca River, respectively. At the time it was considered the seventh largest suspension bridge worldwide. The bridge is a single suspension span supported from four pyramidal towers - two on each bank of the river - with each tower anchoring two cables. The span has a main central section which cars and smaller trucks can cross, and two pedestrian paths on either side of the central roadway. All three paths have wood upper surfaces. Construction started in 1887, under the direction of engineer José María Villa , after authorization by Marcelino Vélez, governor of Antioquia. The cables and other steel parts were purchased from England, while the towers were constructed of local materials. The Puente de Occidente was initially open only to pedestrian traffic; later, vehicles were allowed. While today there are other, much longer suspension bridges in South America, originally the Puente de Occidente was the longest of its kind in the continent. It was declared a National Monument of Colombia on 26 November 1978. José María Villa, who had been born nearby in Sopetrán, studied engineering at the Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey; after finishing his studies in the United States, he participated in the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge. The structural system of the Puente de Occidente is similar to the suspension/cable-stayed hybrid used in the Brooklyn Bridge. Significant restoration was performed in the early part of 2014."

4,45,"Johnny Johnson is a musical with a book and lyrics by Paul Green and music by Kurt Weill. Based on Jaroslav Hašek's satiric novel The Good Soldier Švejk, the musical focuses on a naive and idealistic young man who, despite his pacifist views, leaves his sweetheart Minny Belle Tompkins to fight in Europe in World War I. He first tries to stop the war after meeting a young German sniper of the same name, who believes that the soldiers must unite. However, the commanders of the allied forces intend to use the discontent with the war among the German soldiers as a perfect time to advance in the war. Johnny then manages to bring the skirmish to a temporary halt by incapacitating a meeting of the generals with laughing gas, but once they recover they promptly reinstate the war, resulting in hundreds of thousands of fatalities. Meanwhile Johnny finds himself committed to an asylum for ten years. He returns home to discover Minny Belle has married a capitalist, and he settles down as a toymaker who will create anything except tin soldiers, his personal gesture of peace in an increasingly warlike society. Its title was inspired by the fact the name appeared on United States casualty rolls more often than any other.

7,28,"(For the community in Pennsylvania named Roaring Creek, see Roaring Creek Township, Columbia County, Pennsylvania.) Roaring Creek is a tributary of the Susquehanna River in Columbia County and Montour County, in Pennsylvania, in the United States. It is slightly more than 20 miles (32 km) long and flows through Roaring Creek Township, Locust Township, Catawissa Township, Cleveland Township, and Franklin Township in Columbia County and Mayberry Township in Montour County. The watershed of the creek has an area of 87.3 square miles (226 km2). It has three named tributaries: South Branch Roaring Creek, Lick Run, and Mill Creek. The creek is not considered to be impaired and is not affected by coal mining. However, its watershed has been impacted by human land use. Claystones, conglomerates, sandstones, siltstones, and shales all occur within the watershed. The creek flows through a gorge in its lower reaches, along the border between Columbia County and Montour County. Most of the watershed of Roaring Creek is in Columbia County, but small areas are in Montour County, Northumberland County, and Schuylkill County. More than 40 percent of the watershed is forested and nearly 40 percent is agricultural land. State game lands and state forests are also in the watershed. A total of approximately 3,500 people inhabit the watershed, as of 2000. The creek's drainage basin is a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery upstream of Lick Run. Downstream of Lick Run, the main stem is a Trout Stocked Fishery and Migratory Fishery. A reach of the creek above Lick Run is designated as Class A Wild Trout Waters. 31 species of fish were observed at 20 sites in the watershed in 2003 and 2004. Roaring Creek was historically known as Popemetang, but it was known as Roaring Creek by the late 1700s. Settlers such as Quakers first arrived in the area in the 1770s. In the 19th century, various mills and furnaces were constructed on the creek and several bridges were constructed. Agriculture was also a major industry in the watershed in the early 20th century. More bridges were constructed across the creek in the 20th century. The Roaring Creek Valley Conservation Association formed in February 2006. Part of the creek is navigable by canoe."

7,67,"The Roman Catholic Diocese of Nancy is a diocese of the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic church in France. Erected in 1777, the diocese is currently suffragan to the Archdiocese of Besançon The title of count and the rights of sovereignty of the medieval Bishops of Toul originated in certain grants which Henry the Fowler gave St. Gauzelin in 927. During the Conflict of Investitures in 1108, the chapter became divided: the majority elected Riquin of Commercy as bishop; the minority chose Conrad of Schwarzenburg. Henry V granted Conrad the title of bishop, with the stipulation that he did not exercise episcopal office. In 1271 grave differences broke out again in the chapter of Toul. In 1278 Pope Nicholas III personally appointed Conrad of Tübingen as bishop. Thereafter, it was generally the Holy See which appointed the bishops, alleging various reasons as vacancies arose. As a result, many Italian prelates held this important see until 1552, when Toul was occupied by France. In 1597 Charles III, duke of Lorraine asked Pope Clement VIII for the dismemberment of the See of Toul and the creation of a see at Nancy; this failed through the opposition of Arnaud d'Ossat, Henry's ambassador at Rome. In the end, Clement VIII decided that Nancy was to have a primatial church and that its prelate would have the title of Primate of Lorraine and wear episcopal insignia, but should not exercise episcopal jurisdiction. In 1648 according to the Treaty of Westphalia the bishoprics of Metz, Toul and Verdun (all belonging to the Holy Roman Empire) became French cities. The duchy of Lothringen, surrounded by French territories and repeatedly occupied by French troops, finally fell to the French, and Lorraine became a French province. After the French revolution of 1789 France was divided into departments—Lorraine consisted of the departments of Meurthe, Meuse, Moselle and Vosges. Nancy, Verdun, Metz and Epinal became the capitals of these departments. In 1777 and 1778 Toul lost territories out of which were formed two new dioceses: Saint-Die and Nancy, both of them suffragans of Trier. The Concordat of 1802, suppressing Toul, made Nancy the seat of a vast diocese which included three Departments: Meurthe, Meuse, and Vosges. Eventually the latter two were detached from Nancy on the re-establishment of the Dioceses of Verdun and Saint-Dié in 1822. Since 1824 the bishops of Nancy have borne the title of Bishops of Nancy and Toul, as the ancient Diocese of Toul is almost entirely united with Nancy."
7,39,"7517 Alisondoane, provisional designation 1989 AD, is a carbonaceous asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, about 9 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 3 January 1989, by Japanese amateur astronomer Takuo Kojima at the YGCO Chiyoda Station in the northern Kantō region of Japan. The C-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.8–3.1 AU once every 3 years and 10 months (1,398 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.26 and an inclination of 6 degrees from the plane of the ecliptic. A photometric light-curve analysis by Czech astronomer Petr Pravec in 2007 rendered a rotation period of 9.701±0.001 hours with a high brightness amplitude of 1.13 in magnitude (U=3). Based on observations by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid has an albedo of 0.128 and 0.122 with a diameter of 9.3 and 9.1 kilometers, respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) calculates a smaller diameter of 5.4 kilometers based on an assumed albedo of 0.20, untypically high for a carbonaceous asteroid.

The Newcastle Aero Club (NAC) selected a site after careful consideration and began preparations and cleared the land at District Park in 1928, to create a grassed runway. The first aircraft to land at the aerodrome was an Avro 504K, registered as VH-UBC, on 4 September 1929, which had Newcastle's Own painted on one side of the tail rudder and Spirit of Newcastle painted on the other side. The first Tiger Moth in Australia delivered on 2 June 1935, registered as VH-UTD and named Halycon, was kept at the aerodrome by the NAC. Early pioneering aviators Charles Kingsford Smith, Jean Batten and Bert Hinkler visited the aerodrome during their flights up and down the east coast of Australia. During World War II, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) utilised the aerodrome as a satellite aerodrome to RAAF Williamtown. The NAC workshops over-hauled RAAF trainers and manufactured wooden wing-tips for the Mosquito fighter bomber. The aerodrome was also utilised by PBY Catalina, Supermarine Walrus and Dakotas.

Ball) is a species of juniper, native across the northern Mediterranean region from southwestern Spain east to western Turkey and Cyprus, growing on coastal sand dunes from sea level up to 75 m altitude. It is a spreading shrub 2–5 m tall, rarely a small tree up to 14 m tall. The leaves are broad lanceolate, produced in whorls of three, green, 12–20 mm long and 2–3 mm broad, with a double white stomatal band split by a green midrib on the inner surface. It is dioecious, with separate male and female plants. The seed cones are berry-like, green ripening in 18 months to orange-red with a variable pink waxy coating; they are spherical, 12–18 mm diameter, and have six fused scales in two whorls, three of the scales with a single seed. The seeds are dispersed when birds eat the cones, digesting the fleshy scales and passing the hard seeds in their droppings. The pollen cones are yellow, 2–3 mm long, and fall soon after shedding their pollen in late winter. Despite its distinct morphology with large cones and broad leaves more like those of Juniperus drupacea, it has often been treated as a subspecies of Juniperus oxycedrus, though recent genetic studies have shown its DNA is distinct from that of J. oxycedrus."

It was firstpublished in 1923, so it is one ofthe few poems in the collection that is not free of copyright, but itis quoted here in full as justified by fair use for scholarlycommentary. The Public Square A slash of angular blacks Like a fractured edifice That was buttressed by blue slats In a coma of the moon. A slash and the edifice fell, Pylon and pier fell down. A mountain-blue cloud arose Like a thing in which they fell, Fell slowly as when at night A languid janitor bears His lantern through colonnades And the architecture swoons. It turned cold and silent. Then The square began to clear. The bijou of Atlas, the moon, Was last with its porcelain leer. The violence of an edifice's demolition is matched by the violence ofthe poem's language, particularly in the first two stanzas. Theslow-motion collapse is captured in the surreal atmosphere created bythe third stanza. The final stanza etches a precise image of thesquare's clearing. The harshness of the poem can be compared to the brutal encounter withBerserk in \""Anecdote of the Prince of Peacocks\"", with which it sharesan architectural motif. Buttel detects the influence of Cubism."

8,57,"Marmora's warbler (Sylvia sarda) is a typical warbler, genus Sylvia. The genus name is from Modern Latin silvia, a woodland sprite, related to silva, a wood. The specific sarda is a Latin feminine form for a person from Sardinia. It breeds on Mediterranean islands, typically including Corsica and Sardinia. The smaller Balearic Islands bird is increasingly given specific status as Balearic warbler, Sylvia balearica. These two seem to form a superspecies which in turn groups with Tristram's warbler and the Dartford warbler. They are generally resident but some birds migrate south to winter in north Africa. They are rare vagrants to northern and western Europe. These are small, long tailed, large-headed birds, overall very similar to their close relatives in the Dartford warbler group. Marmora's warblers are grey above and below, lacking the brick-red underparts of the Dartford warbler. Adult males have darker patches on the forehead and between the eye and the pointed bill. The legs and iris are red. The song is a fast rattle. Immature birds can be confused with young Dartford warblers, which are also grey below, but Marmora's have a paler throat. Their iris is dark. These small passerine birds are found in open country with thorny bushes and heather. 3-5 eggs are laid in a nest in a bush. Like most warblers, they are insectivorous. This bird is named after the Italian naturalist Alberto della Marmora."

9,60,"John Engstead (22 September 1909 in California - 15 April 1983 in West Hollywood, California ) was an American photographer. Engstead began his career in 1926, when he was hired as an office boy by Paramount Pictures' head of studio publicity, Harold Harley. In 1927, Engstead pleased his boss by arranging a photo session for actress Clara Bow with photographer Otto Dyar using an outdoor setting which was unusual at that time. Engstead's creative direction of photographs of actress Louise Brooks led to a promotion to art supervisor, where he oversaw the production of Paramount's publicity stills. In 1932, due to a strike by photographers, Engstead assumed the position of studio portrait photographer, despite having never previously photographed anyone. Actor Cary Grant posed for his practice shots. He returned to his job as art supervisor after the strike was resolved. In 1941, Paramount Pictures fired Engstead, and Harper's Bazaar hired him for freelance advertising and portrait photography assignments. From 1941 to 1949, he took fashion photography assignments from numerous other magazines, including Collier's, Esquire, House Beautiful, Ladies Home Journal, Life, Look, Mademoiselle, McCall's, Vogue, and Women's Home Companion. In the 1940s, Engstead photographed many celebrities, including Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Maureen O'Hara and Shirley Temple. Unlike other photographers, he often shot his subjects at home or outdoors, and his portraits of Judy Garland in Carmel, California were particularly successful. During this decade, he built a studio in Los Angeles that became a gathering place for celebrities. Engstead continued to photograph movie stars and other celebrities through the 1950s (Marilyn Monroe) and 1960s. He produced promotional material for many television personalities, including Pat Boone, Carmel Quinn, Donna Reed, Ozzie and Harriet, Eve Arden, and Lucille Ball. He also shot cover photos for albums recorded by singers such as Peggy Lee and Connie Francis, as well as society portraits. His work extended into governmental figures in the 1950s, including then-Second Lady Pat Nixon. Engstead closed his studio in 1970 but continued to accept special portrait and television assignments until his death in 1984 at age 72.Engstead's images are represented by the Motion Picture and Television Photo Archive and can be viewed by the public at MPTV.net"

Centuries after her death, she was described by the Norman-Welsh chronicler Geraldus Cambrensis (died 1223) as the sister of King Osred I of Northumbria, which would make her the daughter of King Aldfrith of Northumbria. Osana was depicted by Geraldus as inflicting a miraculous flagellation from her grave in Howden, Yorkshire, upon a concubine of the priest of the collegiate church there, a moral tale intended to inculcate clerical celibacy. Celibacy of the Anglo-Saxon clergy was not expected in Osana's time; when it began to be enforced from the top at even the higher levels, with Archbishop Anselm's council of London, 1102, it continued to be resisted in Britain, though it was a central objective of Gregorian reform. Geraldus records \""In the north of England beyond the Humber, in the church of Hovedene, the concubine of the rector incautiously sat down on the tomb of St. Osana, sister of king Osred, which projected like a wooden seat; on wishing to retire, she could not be removed, until the people came to her assistance; her clothes were rent, her body was laid bare, and severely afflicted with many strokes of discipline, even till the blood flowed; nor did she regain her liberty, until by many tears and sincere repentance she had showed evident signs of compunction.\"" There had been no previous record of Osana. On the authority of Geraldus Cambrensis, the Bollandists named 18 June a feast for Osana. Relics of Osana are known to be preserved in a church in the Netherlands."

9,34,"John Russell, 1st Earl Russell, KG, GCMG, PC (18 August 1792 – 28 May 1878), known as Lord John Russell before 1861, was a leading Whig and Liberal politician who served as Prime Minister on two occasions during the mid-19th century. Scion of one of the most powerful aristocratic families, his great achievements, says A. J. P. Taylor, were based on his indefatigable battles in Parliament over the years on behalf of the expansion of liberty; after each loss he tried again and again, until finally his efforts were largely successful. Woodward, however, argued that he was too much the abstract theorist, so that \""He was more concerned with the removal of obstacles to civil liberty than with the creation of a more reasonable and civilized society. Nevertheless Russell led his Whig Party into support for reform; he was the principal architect of the great Reform Act of 1832. As Prime Minister his luck ran out. He took much of the blame for the government's failures in dealing with the Irish famine. Taylor concludes that as prime minister, he was not a success. Indeed, his Government of 1846 to 1852 was the ruin of the Whig party: it never composed a Government again, and his Government of 1865 to 1866, which might be described as the first Liberal Government, was very nearly the ruin of the Liberal party also."

The specimen was deposited in the Natural History Museum, London. F. O.

Italy launched various attacks around the Mediterranean, which were largely unsuccessful. With the introduction of German forces, Yugoslavia and Greece were overrun. Allied and Axis forces engaged in back and forth fighting across North Africa, with Axis interference in the Middle East causing fighting to spread there. With confidence high from early gains, German forces planned elaborate attacks to be launched to capture the Middle East and then to possibly attack the southern border of the Soviet Union. However, following three years of fighting, Axis forces were defeated in North Africa and their interference in the Middle East was halted. Allied forces then commenced an invasion of Southern Europe, resulting in the Italians deposing Mussolini and joining the Allies. A prolonged battle for Italy took place between Allied and German forces, and as the strategic situation changed in south-east Europe, British troops returned to Greece. The theatre of war had the longest duration of the Second World War, resulted in the destruction of the Italian Empire and altered the strategic position of Germany, resulting in German divisions being deployed to Africa and Italy and total losses (including those captured upon final surrender) being over half a million. Italian losses amounted to around 177,000 men with a further several hundred thousand captured during the process of the various campaigns. British losses amount to over 300,000 men killed, wounded, or captured, and total American losses in the region amounted to 130,000."

Alexis-Charles-Henri Clérel de Tocqueville (French: [alɛksi ʃaʁl ɑ̃ʁi kleʁɛl də tɔkvil]; 29 July 1805 – 16 April 1859) was a French diplomat, political scientist, and historian. He was best known for his works Democracy in America (appearing in two volumes: 1835 and 1840) and The Old Regime and the Revolution (1856). In both he analyzed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals, as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. Democracy in America was published after Tocqueville's travels in the United States and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science. Tocqueville was active in French politics, first under the July Monarchy (1830–48) and then during the Second Republic (1849–51) which succeeded the February 1848 Revolution. He retired from political life after Louis Napoléon Bonaparte's 2 December 1851 coup, and thereafter began work on The Old Regime and the Revolution. He argued the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King Louis XIV. The failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals. Tocqueville was a classical liberal who advocated parliamentary government, but he was skeptical of the extremes of democracy."

9,40,"Chislehurst and Sidcup Grammar School is a mixed-sex grammar school with academy status located in Hurst Road (A222), Sidcup in the London Borough of Bexley, England. It is located adjacent to Lamorbey Park, the Rose Bruford College drama school and Hurstmere Foundation School. Pupils at the school are divided into a series of six houses, known as Davies, Edlemann, Lester, Townshend, Williams, and Staff, while an annual school magazine, The Chronicle, is also produced by the students. The current head teacher, Nigel Walker, has held his position since 2009 -when he first became head teacher. Founded as the Sidcup County School for Boys in 1931 to meet the lack of secondary schools in the newly urbanised town, it was initially opened at 27 Station Road, with the position of first headmaster being given to C. R. McGregor Williams. In 1935, the school began moving into a purpose-built site at Critall's Corner, Footscray, being renamed Chislehurst and Sidcup County School in 1938. Damaged during The Blitz, after the culmination of the Second World War, reforms implemented as a result of the Education Act 1944 led to the local decision that the institution would become a grammar school and that it would relocate to a new, larger building on Hurst Road in the Lamorbey area of Sidcup, a move that took place after the resignation of McGregor Williams in 1954. As a result of the government's Circular 10/65 in 1965, plans were implemented to merge Chislehurst and Sidcup with the neighbouring Hurstmere into a single comprehensive school, although these were opposed by the successive Conservative Party administrations of Bexley Council, eventually being scuppered under the Conservative government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s. In 1973 the school was made co-educational, admitting female pupils alongside the male, resulting in the adoption of its current name. The school rose to national headlines in January 1983 following the suspension of most of the school's sixth form for drinking alcohol at the preceding Christmas party. In 2004 it became a sports college and in 2011 an academy."

9,49,"(Not to be confused with Socialist Propaganda League of America.) The Socialist Propaganda League was a tiny socialist group active in London from circa 1911 to 1951. The League was formed as a result of an early dispute in the Socialist Party of Great Britain and of the optimistic belief of the Party’s founder members that the socialist revolution was near. A group of members around Henry Martin and Augustus Snellgrove wanted the Party to take a definitive stand on the attitude socialist delegates elected to parliament or local councils would take towards reform measures proposed by one or more of the capitalist parties. In February 1910 a letter from \""W.B. (Upton Park)\"" was sent to the Socialist Standard asking, “What would be the attitude of a member of the SPGB if elected to Parliament, and how would he maintain the principle of ‘No Compromise’?” The perspective of this small group of members was that no reform of capitalism could ever be supported by the party claiming to represent working-class interests as it was not the job of socialists to take part in the running of capitalism. Any attempt to do so would run counter to the famous ‘hostility clause’ of the Party's Declaration of Principles. The Standard’s reply on the matter, backed by the Party’s Executive Committee, stated that each issue would have to be looked at on its merits and the course to be pursued decided democraticallyThis did not satisfy the members who had raised the question, who formed a ‘Provisional Committee’ aimed at overturning the position espoused in the Standard’s reply and who set their case out in an ‘Open Letter’ to Party members, arguing that socialists were required to oppose measures introduced by capitalist parties on each and every occasion. This was again rebutted firmly by the EC who contended that it would be ridiculous for socialists, by way of example, to oppose a measure designed to stop a war in which the working class was being butchered. Believing this approach to be a violation of the principle of ‘no compromise’, several members resigned over this issue during 1911, a small number going on to found the Socialist Propaganda League. The SPL’s principal speaker and writer was Henry Martin, Snellgrove having been one ofthose from the Provisional Committee later to rejoin the SPGB. Though Martin was sympathetic to the SPGB in all other respects, he continued to denounce the its willingness to engage in ‘political trading’ in pamphlets and on the outdoor platform until his death in 1951."

9,6,"Alexander Gordon (c. 1516–1575) was a 16th-century Scottish churchman who was successively archbishop of Glasgow, titular archbishop of Athens, bishop of the Isles and bishop of Galloway. His father was John Gordon, Lord Gordon and his mother was Margaret Stewart, an illegitimate daughter of James IV of Scotland. He was the brother of George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly, the ex-Chancellor of Scotland. He acquired his first ecclesiastic appointment, as administrator of Caithness, despite competition with Robert Stewart, brother of the Earl of Lennox. He was provided and consecrated to the archdiocese of Glasgow in the year 1550. This see was resigned to the pope in 1551, and he was given a pension and the title archbishop of Athens in partibus, along with the commendam of Inchaffray. In 1553, he was translated to the bishopric of the Isles (Sodor) at Iona. In 1559, after the death of the bishop of Galloway, Alexander was translated that bishopric. Alexander became a Protestant, and died on 11 November 1575. In 1544, Alexander described himself as a servant of Francis I of France, and he was a loyal and well rewarded servant to the Queen Dowager, Mary of Guise. Apart from his ecclesiastical preferments, Guise gave him a yearly pension of £200 on 17 January 1547. The next year Alexander claimed poverty because Robert Stewart had possession of his Caithness rents, but he wrote that he would not tempted by English offers, 'for suppose poverty banish me from your grace's service, riches shall not cause me offend.' Alexander sent Mary of Guise a vivid account of the capture of Ferniehirst Castle from the French in February 1549. He was there in the company of his brother George, Earl of Huntly. Alexander travelled through England to Scotland with a retinue of 12 followers in April 1553. Alexander preached at the wedding of his niece Jean Gordon to the Earl of Bothwell on 24 February 1566. A year later, Alexander was a signatory to Ainslie's Tavern Band in April 1567, agreeing to the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots to Bothwell. John Gordon, future Bishop of Galloway, was the son of Alexander Gordon and his wife Barbara Logie. John seems to have been illegitimate; his parents married, perhaps clandestinely, only in 1546, before Alexander obtained ecclesiastical preferment."

8,44,"The Phantom Chance (foaled 3 November 1989) is a New Zealand Thoroughbred racehorse who won the New Zealand Derby in 1992 and Cox Plate in 1993, earning over $2 million in his 44-race career. The gelding didn't race at two and made a slow start to his three-year-old career, finishing third in his first two starts. But then he won eight races on end, six of them at stakes level, including the Derby and the Group 1 Cambridge Stud International Stakes against the older horses to confirm his status as New Zealand's champion three-year-old for the season. His Derby win gave trainer Colin Jillings his fifth win in the race, a number that no other trainer has matched. As a four-year-old the horse's great success continued not only in New Zealand but also across the Tasman. He started his Australian career with a narrow win in the Turnbull Stakes at Flemington, and after a Group 1 placing at Caulfield became the second New Zealand Derby winner in three years (after Surfers Paradise) to win the Cox Plate, beating fellow New Zealander Solvit by a length and a half in the 1993 running of Australia's weight-for-age championship. He continued to race through to the age of 8, and occasionally experienced success in both New Zealand and Australia at stakes level. He wasn't the same horse as he was at three and four though, and as a result his record probably looks less impressive now than it should."

They were eliminated in the third round of the FA Cup, and reached the Football League Cup final for the first time since 1963, facing Liverpool. Liverpool took the lead in the 30th minute through Robbie Fowler, but Birmingham equalised in the last minute of normal time with a Darren Purse penalty. No further goals were scored in extra time, so the match was settled in a penalty shoot-out; Martin Grainger's and Andrew Johnson's penalties were saved, and Liverpool won 5–4 on penalties. The top scorer for the season was Geoff Horsfield, with twelve goals in all competitions, of which seven were in the League; Marcelo also scored seven league goals."
3,4,"Minor v. Happersett, 88 U.S. 162 (1875), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the Constitution did not grant women the right to vote. The Supreme Court upheld state court decisions in Missouri, which had refused to register a woman as a lawful voter because that state's laws allowed only men to vote. The Minor v. Happersett ruling was based on an interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court readily accepted that Minor was a citizen of the United States, but it held that the constitutionally protected privileges of citizenship did not include the right to vote. The Nineteenth Amendment, which became a part of the Constitution in 1920, effectively overruled Minor v. Happersett by prohibiting discrimination in voting rights based on gender. Minor v. Happersett continued to be cited in support of restrictive election laws of other types until the 1960s, when the Supreme Court started interpreting the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause to guarantee voting rights."

1,69,"The 2005 United States Grand Prix was one of the most controversial Formula One motor races in modern history. It was held on June 19, 2005 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and was the ninth race of the 2005 Formula One season. Out of the 20 cars that entered for the race, only the six cars from the teams using Bridgestone tyres (Ferrari, Jordan and Minardi) competed. The remaining fourteen entrants, all using Michelin tyres, completed the parade lap (thus having technically taken part in the race, avoiding punishment), but retired to the pits before the race started. Following several tyre failures before the race, most spectacularly on Ralf Schumacher's Toyota during Friday practice, Michelin advised its seven customer teams that without a reduction in speed in Turn 13, the tyres provided for the race would only be safe for 10 laps. Michelin had been providing working tyres for the race since 2001. The situation was worsened by the 2005 Formula One rules, which forbade tyre changes during the race. The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the sport's governing body, refused a compromise proposal from Michelin to allow a chicane to be installed, maintaining that such rule changes would be grossly unfair to the Bridgestone-shod teams, who had come prepared with properly working tyres, and that a last-minute change to the track layout would be dangerous in case of crashes. The Michelin teams, unable to come to a compromise with the FIA, decided not to participate. It was later revealed that the Michelin-shod teams could have potentially exposed themselves to criminal liability under Indiana state law had they competed. Of the six competitors, Ferrari's Michael Schumacher was the eventual winner, with his teammate Rubens Barrichello finishing second. The result significantly boosted Schumacher's championship standing, placing him third overall—no driver above him in driver championship points took part in the race. This race also marked the Toyota team's first Formula One pole position, which did not lead to a win due to the team's withdrawal from the race start. The final race result was the lowest number of finishing entries ever seen in a major open-wheel motorsports event at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway since the institution of the 500-Mile Race (surpassing the previous record low of seven finishers in 1966, a race marred by a major first lap accident that eliminated a full third of the starting field), and the lowest number of finishing entries for an international Grand Prix since the 1914 American Grand Prize, which saw only five finishers. The situation created enormous negative publicity for the sport of Formula One, especially in the United States, a market in which Formula One had struggled to establish itself over the preceding twenty years; some even called the race \""Indygate\""."

1,48,"The 1983 United Kingdom general election was held on 9 June 1983. It gave the Conservative Party under Margaret Thatcher the most decisive election victory since that of Labour in 1945. Thatcher's first four years as prime minister had not been an easy time. Unemployment increased during the first three years of her term and the economy went through a recession. However, the British victory in the Falklands War led to a recovery of her popularity; the economy had also returned to growth. By the time Thatcher called the election in May 1983, the Conservatives were most people's firm favourites to win the election. The Labour Party had been led by Michael Foot since the resignation of James Callaghan. They had fared well in opinion polls and local elections during this time, but issues developed which would lead directly to their defeat. Labour adopted a platform that was considered more left-wing than usual. Several moderate Labour MPs had left the party to form the Social Democrats. The Social Democrats then formed the SDP-Liberal Alliance with the existing Liberal Party. The opposition vote split almost evenly between the SDP/Liberal Alliance and Labour. With its worst performance since 1918, the Labour vote fell by over 3 million from 1979 and this accounted for both a national swing of almost 4% towards the Conservatives and their larger parliamentary majority of 144, even though the Conservatives' total vote fell by almost 700,000. This was the most recent election where a party in government increased its number of seats until 2015. The SDP/Liberal Alliance finished in third place but came within 700,000 votes of out-polling Labour. By gaining 25% of the popular vote, the Alliance won the largest such percentage for any third party since the 1923 general election. Despite this, they won only 23 seats, whereas Labour won 209. The Liberals argued that a proportional electoral system would have given them a more representative number of MPs. Changing the electoral system had been a long-running Liberal Party campaign plank and would later be adopted by the Liberal Democrats. The election night was broadcast live on the BBC, and was presented by Peter Snow, David Dimbleby and Robin Day. Two future prime ministers, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, were first elected as MP's in this election."

9,6,"The devotion to the Sacred Heart (also known as the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus, Sacratissimi Cordis Iesu in Latin) is one of the most widely practiced and well-known Roman Catholic devotions, taking Jesus Christ's physical heart as the representation of His divine love for humanity. This devotion is predominantly used in the Roman Catholic Church and among some high-church Anglicans and Lutherans. The devotion is especially concerned with what the Church deems to be the love and compassion of the heart of Christ towards humanity, and its long suffering. The origin of this devotion in its modern form is derived from a Roman Catholic nun from France, Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque, who said she learned the devotion from Jesus during a series of apparitions to her between 1673 and 1675, and later, in the 19th century, from the mystical revelations of another Roman Catholic nun in Portugal, Blessed Mary of the Divine Heart, a religious of the Good Shepherd, who requested, in the name of Christ that Pope Leo XIII consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Predecessors to the modern devotion arose unmistakably in the Middle Ages in various facets of Catholic mysticism."
4,45,"\""Uptight (Everything's Alright)\"" is a 1966 hit single recorded by Stevie Wonder for the Tamla (Motown) label. One of his most popular early singles, \""Uptight (Everything's Alright)\"" was the first Stevie Wonder hit single to be co-written by the artist. The single was a watershed in Wonder's career for several reasons. Aside from the number-one hit \""Fingertips\"", only two of Wonder's singles had reached the Top 40 of Billboard's Pop Singles chart, (\""Workout, Stevie Workout\"" reached #33 in late 1963 and \""Hey Harmonica Man\"" reached #29 Pop in the Summer of 1964) and the fifteen-year-old artist was in danger of being let go. In addition, Wonder's voice had begun to change, and Motown CEO Berry Gordy was worried that he would no longer be a commercially viable artist. As it turned out, however, producer Clarence Paul found it easier to work with Wonder's now-mature tenor voice, and Sylvia Moy and Henry Cosby set about writing a new song for the artist, based upon an instrumental riff Wonder had devised. Nelson George, in Where Did Our Love Go? The Rise and Fall of the Motown Sound, recorded that Wonder had also sought something based on the driving beat of the Rolling Stones's \""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction,\"" after playing several dates with the Stones on tour and being impressed with the British band. As Wonder presented his ideas, finished or not, \""he went through everything,\"" remembered Moy. \""I asked, 'Are you sure you don't have anything else?' He started singing and playing 'Everything is alright, uptight.' That was as much as he had. I said, 'That's it. Let's work with that.'\"" The resulting song, \""Uptight (Everything's Alright)\"", features lyrics which depict a poor young man's appreciation for a rich girl's seeing beyond his poverty to his true worth. On the day of the recording, Moy had completed the lyrics, but didn't have them in Braille for Wonder to read, and so sang the song to him as he was recording it. She sang a line ahead of him, and he simply repeated the lines as he heard them. In 2008, Moy commented that \""he never missed a beat\"" during the recording. A notable success, \""Uptight (Everything's Alright)\"" peaked at number 3 on the Billboard Pop Singles chart in early 1966, at the same time reaching the top of the Billboard R&B Singles chart for five weeks. Billboard ranked it as the 59th biggest American hit of 1966. An accompanying album, Up-Tight, was rushed into production to capitalize on the single's success."

9,6,"Pope Romanus (died November 897) was Pope from August to November 897. He was the supposed nephew of Pope Marinus I. Romanus, whose personal name is unknown, was born in Gallese, Italy near Civita Castellana. Romanus was son of Constantine. He was installed as the cardinal of St. Peter ad Vincula prior to his election to the papacy. During his short reign, he granted the Farfa Abbey Abbot Vitalis the pallium (a vestment in the Catholic Church), and appointed Vitalis as the patriarch of Grado. Romanus also confirmed the possessions of the Spanish bishops of Gerona and Elna of their sees. He was elected to succeed the murdered Pope Stephen VI during a period when the papacy was fought over by various Italian factions. Pope Stephen VI was murdered after exhuming Pope Formosus's corpse for the posthumous Cadaver Synod, in which, Stephen VI put charges to Formosus' \""propped up\"" body. Like many popes of the era, Romanus annulled all the acts and decrees of his predecessor. His short rule was regarded as a virtuous one by contemporary historian Flodoard, but 15th-century historian Bartolomeo Platina scorned him for continuing the practice of annulling the acts and decrees of his predecessor. Romanus died in November 897 of an unknown cause, however it is believed that he could have been deposed by supporters of his predecessor Pope Stephen VI, who was of an opposing faction. This belief is due to the description that \""he was made a monk\"" and served as one towards the end of his life was used at the time to describe deposition."

9,13,"Robert Kirkham \""Bob\"" Birket (17 November 1874 – 18 August 1933) was an English professional footballer who spent his entire ten-year football league career with Blackpool after signing from Fleetwood Rangers. He made his debut for Blackpool on 14 November 1896, in a 3–1 victory over Lincoln City at Raikes Hall. He scored the hosts' first goal. That was his only appearance in the 1896–97 campaign. Birket made fourteen league appearances the following season, 1897–98, scoring eight goals. In 1898–99, he was the club's top scorer with fifteen goals in his 24 appearances. His efforts were not enough to keep Blackpool in the Football League, however: they failed to be re-elected, along with Darwen. In Blackpool's one season in League exile, 1899–90, Birket became the first Blackpool to score a hat-trick. It came against Darwen on 16 November 1899. He also scored five in a Boxing Day victory over Stockport County and four against Wigan Athletic on 17 March 1900. Birket continued his scoring ways for Blackpool's first season back in the Football League, with ten strikes, again finishing as the club's top scorer. For the second half of the 1901–02 campaign, Birket was moved to the right-back position. As to be expected his goals dried up and he found the net only twice in his 26 appearances. He continued in the right-back berth for the remainder of his career, with the majority of his infrequent goals coming from the penalty spot. Birket played his last game on 22 September 1906, just four games into Blackpool's 1906–07 campaign."

It was the second tournament to have a group stage involving the eight second round winners split into two groups, and the winner of each one met in the final. In addition, a preliminary round was required as this was the first season after the break-up of the USSR and Yugoslavia, resulting in a large number of new countries eligible to enter the champions of their own leagues into the competition. Israel and the Faroe Islands were also represented for the first time. The tournament was won for the first time by Marseille, defeating Milan in the final. However, soon after Marseille's victory allegations of match fixing were levelled at them and their president Bernard Tapie. This involved a league game where Marseille, it emerged, had fixed their title-clinching Division 1 game against Valenciennes so they could concentrate on the Milan tie. It is believed that Tapie bribed Valenciennes to lose so that Marseille would win the French league earlier, giving them more time to prepare for the European Cup final. This resulted in Marseille being stripped of their league title by the French Football Federation (although not the European Cup, as the match in question was not in that competition). They were banned from defending their European title in the 1993–94 season, and contesting the Intercontinental Cup and Super Cup. In 1994 Marseille was also relegated to the Division 2.

The Battle of Lade (Greek: Ναυμαχία τῆς Λάδης, Naumachia tēs Ladēs) was a naval battle which occurred during the Ionian Revolt, in 494 BC.

The Ionian Revolt was triggered by the dissatisfaction of the Greek cities of Asia Minor with the tyrants appointed by Persia to rule them. In 499 BC, the then-tyrant of Miletus, Aristagoras, launched a joint expedition with the Persian satrap Artaphernes to conquer Naxos, in an attempt to bolster his position in Miletus. The mission was a debacle, and sensing his imminent removal as tyrant, Aristagoras chose to incite the whole of Ionia into rebellion against the Persian king Darius the Great. Initially, in 498 BC, the Ionians went on the offensive, supported by troops from Athens and Eretria, capturing Sardis, before suffering defeat at the Battle of Ephesus. The revolt then spread to Caria and Cyprus. Three years of Persian campaigning across Asia Minor followed, with no decisive effect. By 494 BC the Persian army and navy had regrouped, and made straight for the epicentre of the rebellion at Miletus. The Ionians sought to defend Miletus by sea, leaving the defense of Miletus to the Milesians. The Ionian fleet gathered at the island of Lade, off the coast of Miletus. The Persians were uncertain of victory at Lade, so attempted to persuade some of the Ionian contingents to defect. Although this was unsuccessful at first, when the Persians finally attacked the Ionians, the Samian fleet accepted the Persian offer. As the Persian and Ionian fleets met, the Samians sailed away from the battle, causing the collapse of the Ionian battle line. Although the Chian contingent and a few other ships remained and fought bravely against the Persians, the battle was lost. With the defeat at Lade, the Ionian Revolt was all but ended. The next year, the Persians reduced the last rebel strongholds, and began the process of bringing peace to the region. The Ionian Revolt constituted the first major conflict between ancient Greece and Persia, and as such represents the first phase of the Greco-Persian Wars. Although Asia Minor had been brought back into the Persian fold, Darius vowed to punish Athens and Eretria for their support of the revolt. Moreover, seeing that the myriad city states of Greece posed a continued threat to the stability of his empire, he decided to conquer the whole of Greece. In 492 BC, the first Persian invasion of Greece, the next phase of the Greco-Persian Wars, would begin as a direct consequence of the Ionian Revolt."

The body is 5–7 millimetres (0.20–0.28 in) long, the head and pronotum are brownish, while elytrae are shining metallic green with a bright red spot at the end. Along the sides of the abdomen this species has a peculiar structure with orange poaches. These beetles mainly inhabit meadows at low altitudes. During the day they stay on herbs and flowers, including flowers of garden plants, mainly on Apiaceae, Asteraceae and Rosaceae species, where they feed on pollen, nectar and small insects. In case of necessity, this beetle can release a smell that deters predators. The males attract females producing special secretions from its antennae. Malachius bipustulatus is an insect with a complete metamorphism, (or holometabolism), with four life stages (egg, larva, pupa and imago or adult). The pupal stage is a period of rest, when inner and outer bodies change. The larvae and the adults largely differ in physique and lifestyle. The larvae usually live under bark, in old wood or on the ground in grass roots, hunting small insects, larvae and slugs. \n*"

It was fought on 16 May 1808 in Vatlestraumen, outside Bergen in Norway, between the British frigate HMS Tartar and a Norwegian force consisting of four kanonjolles and one kanonsjalupps (collectively known as gunboats). The British Royal Navy was then blockading the coast of Norway, causing major difficulties since the country was then dependent on Danish imports of grain and other foodstuffs. Having lost their fleet in the Battle of Copenhagen in 1807, Denmark-Norway was unable to afford the time or money to rebuild their high-seas fleet of corvettes, frigates and ships of the line and so had been forced to construct small vessels or gunboats for coastal defence. The British frigate was underway to Bergen harbour in search of a Dutch privateer named Gelderland, known by the British to be seeking shelter in the harbour during repairs. On the evening on 15 May, a message was received at Bergenhus Fortress stating that a British frigate had been sighted, and was probably heading towards Bergen. After the frigate had been sighted at Alvøen, near Bergen, on 16 May, the five vessels making up the entire Norwegian sea force in the Bergen region were ordered to row out and engage the enemy. The frigate lay becalmed outside Alvøen, and in thick fog. The Norwegian vessels took up a position between Alvøen and the frigate, and opened fire. The battle lasted about one hour, during which the British lost 12 men, including Post Captain Bettesworth, commander of the frigate. Norwegian losses were five men and several wounded."

1,48,"The 1976 United States presidential election in Massachusetts took place on November 2, 1976, as part of the 1976 United States presidential election, which was held throughout all 50 states and D.C. Voters chose 14 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President. Massachusetts voted for the Democratic nominee, Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter, over incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford of Michigan. Carter's running mate was Senator Walter Mondale of Minnesota, while Ford ran with Senator Bob Dole of Kansas. Carter carried Massachusetts with 56.11% of the vote to Ford's 40.44%, a 15.67% margin of victory. In a distant third was Independent candidate Eugene McCarthy, a former Democratic Senator from Minnesota known for his anti-war activism, who took 2.58%. As Carter narrowly defeated Ford nationally to win the presidency, Massachusetts weighed in as 13% more Democratic than the national average in the 1976 election. Massachusetts had been a Democratic-leaning state since 1928, and a Democratic stronghold since 1960, so Carter's win was not unexpected. In 1972, Massachusetts was the only state in the nation to vote for Democrat George McGovern over Republican Richard Nixon in the latter's 49-state landslide. McGovern had carried Massachusetts 54-45, despite losing every other state in the midst of a massive Republican landslide. Ford for his part performed relatively strongly in the state as a moderate Northern Republican, holding at just over 40% of the vote, while Carter gained only slightly over McGovern- even though Carter was winning nationally while McGovern was losing in a landslide. The state's capital and largest city, Boston, would be one of the few regions in the country where McGovern would actually perform more strongly than Carter in absolute terms. Suffolk County, where Boston is located, had voted for George McGovern in 1972 by a landslide of 66% versus Richard Nixon's 33%, but in 1976, Carter would only win the county with 61% versus Gerald Ford's 35%. Whereas McGovern had been very popular with urban social liberals in the Northeast in 1972, in 1976 many secular social liberals were turned off by the Southern Evangelical Christian Carter, and the Northern moderate Ford was seen as a preferable alternative to many of these voters in Boston. In the 1960s, for three elections straight beginning with John F. Kennedy in 1960, Democrats had won landslides of over 60% of the vote, with Republicans failing to break 40%. Even in the GOP landslide of 1972, Massachusetts had clocked in as a whopping 32% more Democratic than the nation. Thus overall the results of 1976 indicated a slight Republican rebound in the state that would continue into the 1980s."

The McKenzie Highway was added to the National Register of Historic Places in February, 2011. This highway was the original routing of U.S. Route 28 through the Oregon Cascades until 1952, when it was redesignated as part of U.S. Route 126 (now Oregon Route 126). This highway was built in the 1920s and was the only highway over the Cascades going east out of Eugene until 1962, when a gravel road heading north from Belknap Springs to U.S. Route 20 at Santiam Junction was widened and paved. At that point, the new alignment was designated as US 126, and the old alignment was renamed OR 242. OR 242 is now considered primarily a scenic route. As a result, it is not plowed or sanded, and is thus closed during winter—generally from November 1 until about the July 1 every year, although snows have closed it as early as Labor Day in the past. Snow packs of up to fourteen feet are common on the summit of the road; snow gates are located 7 miles (11 km) east of the junction with OR 126 at Belknap Springs, and 8 miles (13 km) west of Sisters.

This incarnation of OR 242 existed between 1932 and sometime after 1951, when it was replaced with an extended Oregon Route 214. Later, OR 219 was redirected along most of this route to end on Interstate Route 5 in Woodburn, and OR 214 was truncated to the same interchange."

Improved fuel efficiency and compliance with Euro 5 emission standards were also design objectives, by 2010 being updated to the Euro 6 standard; four piezo-electric injectors fed with very high pressure fuel from a common rail inject fuel directly into the combustion chambers to improve combustion compared to previous Mercedes Diesel engines and recirculated exhaust gas reduces the oxygen in the cylinders to \""starve\"" any reactions that would produce NO(x). Although all engines have the same 2,143 cc swept volume, engines with various power outputs are produced ranging from 120 ps (badged x180) through 170 ps (badged x220) to 204 ps (badged x250). The 170 ps and 204 ps versions employ a twin-turbo charger with a small, high pressure turbo providing quick boost at low RPM and a large, lower pressure turbo providing increased performance at higher RPM. The 100kW lower output version has only a single turbocharger."

9,49,"The Federation of South African Trade Unions (FOSATU) was a trade union federation formed at a congress over the weekend of 14–15 April 1979 in Hammanskraal and officially launched five days later on 20 April. Its roots lay in the unions which had emerged from the spontaneous 1973 strike wave by black workers in Durban and Pinetown (part of the \""Durban Moment\""). FOSATU's constitution enshrined the principles of workers' control of their trade unions, non-racialism, worker independence from party politics, international worker solidarity and trade union unity. It strove to build a tight national federation to work towards an industrial workers' bloc firmly based in strong grassroots organisation on the factory floor. It became the first truly national non-racial trade union federation in South African history, building unity and avoiding the regionalism which had pervaded earlier attempts at such an organisation. Its success here has been attributed to the fostering of a national leadership layer of \""organic intellectuals\"" through a strong focus on the political education of shop stewards, and tight integration of the national, provincial and local structures of the organisation. As part of its commitment to trade union unity, FOSATU was prepared to disband its structures if wider unity could be attained. On 1 December 1985, following four years of unity talks between competing trade union federations, FOSATU upheld this pledge by dissolving into the newly formed Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU)."

Like his predecessor at Luxeuil he was born of the noble Frankish family of Duke Waldelenus of Burgundy, highly influential in seventh-century Frankish politics and served in the military before dedicating himself to the contemplative life and joining the monastery at Luxeuil on the borders of Austrasia and Burgundy (in modern-day France), where he dedicated his weapons and armour, which hung in the abbey church for centuries. He lived as a hermit close to the abbey until the death of the monastery's abbot, Saint Eustace of Luxeuil, when Waldebert was elected Luxeuil's third abbot (c. 628).

It consists of the classes Ustilaginomycetes and Exobasidiomycetes, and in 2014 the subphylum was reclassified and the two additional classes Malasseziomycetes and Moniliellomycetes added. The name was first published by Doweld in 2001; Bauer and colleagues later published it in 2006 as an isonym. Ustilagomycotina and Agaricomycotina are considered to be sister groups, and they are in turn sister groups to the subphyla Pucciniomycotina. Ustilaginomycotina comprises 115 genera with more than 1700 species. The subphyla is mostly plant parasites on vascular plants, and the distribution of the subphyla is therefore restricted to the distribution of the host. The group is also called the true smut fungi because of the production of teliospores. The name smut is still used as a term since it circumscribes the organization and life cycle of Ustilaginomycotina, but it is not a taxonomic term.

Although he had studied Law at university, his father insisted that he train as a doctor.

He was a significant figure in the development of the jurisprudence of no-fault divorce in the English courts. His best known finding, in the case Corbett v Corbett (1971), was that the male-to-female transsexual partner to a marriage, while a woman for many legal purposes, did not qualify as a woman for purposes of marriage: sex is clearly an essential determinant of the relationship called marriage because it is and always has been recognized as the union of man and woman. It is the institution on which the family is built, and in which the capacity for natural heterosexual intercourse is an essential element. [...] Having regard to the essentially heterosexual character of the relationship which is called marriage, the criteria must, in my judgement, be biological [...]. My conclusion therefore is that the respondent is not a woman for the purposes of marriage, but is a biological male and has been so since birth. It follows that the so-called marriage of 10 September 1963 is void."

7,12,"The Church of Our Lady & St Alphege is a Roman Catholic church located in the Oldfield Park suburb of Bath, Somerset. The church was built between 1927 and 1929 to the designs of Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, the architect of Liverpool Cathedral. The church is modelled on the Early Christian basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, Rome. It is a Grade II* listed building. The exterior is Romanesque, of Bath Stone rubble. A three-arched loggia with Byzantine columns and capitals surrounds it. The red roof tiles were imported from Lombardy. The full-height campanile intended by Scott was not built, due to fears over the strength of the foundations. The interior columns have capitals with figurative carvings by William Drinkwater Gough. Those on the columns on the north side depict scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary, those on the columns on the south, scenes from the life of St Alphege and those supporting the choir and organ loft on the west end show persons associated with the church, including Scott himself. Scott wrote of the church, \""It has always been one of my favourite works.\"" Relatively unknown since its construction, the church was overlooked by Pevsner in his 1958 North Somerset and Bristol edition of The Buildings of England. Its importance as an \""accomplished composition by (a) nationally-renowned architect\"" was recognised in 2010 when its listed building status was upgraded to Grade II*. Michael Forsyth in the Pevsner Architectural Guide to Bath describes it as a building that \""cannot fail to astonish and delight.\"""

Banaitis, was a case decided before the Supreme Court of the United States, dealing with the issue of whether the portion of a money judgment or settlement paid to a taxpayer's attorney under a contingent-fee agreement is income to the taxpayer for federal income tax purposes. The Supreme Court held when a taxpayer's recovery constitutes income, the taxpayer's income includes the portion of the recovery paid to the attorney as a contingent fee. Employment cases are an exception to this Supreme Court ruling because of the Civil Rights Tax Relief in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The Civil Rights Tax Relief amended Internal Revenue Service § 62(a) to permit taxpayers to subtract attorney’s fees from gross income in arriving at adjusted gross income."

8,57,"The Sillaginidae, commonly known as the smelt-whitings, whitings, sillaginids, sand borers and sand-smelts, are a family of benthic coastal marine fish in the order Perciformes. The smelt-whitings inhabit a wide region covering much of the Indo-Pacific, from the west coast of Africa east to Japan and south to Australia. The family comprises only five genera and 35 species, of which a number are dubious, with the last major revision of the family in 1992 unable to confirm the validity of a number of species. They are elongated, slightly compressed fish, often light brown to silver in colour, with a variety of markings and patterns on their upper bodies. The Sillaginidae are not related to a number of fishes commonly called 'whiting' in the Northern Hemisphere, including the fish originally called whiting, Merlangius merlangus. The smelt-whitings are mostly inshore fishes that inhabit sandy, silty, and muddy substrates on both low- and high-energy environments ranging from protected tidal flats and estuaries to surf zones. A few species predominantly live offshore on deep sand shoals and reefs, although the larvae and juvenile phases of most species return to inshore grounds, where they spend the first few years of their lives. Smelt-whitings are benthic carnivores that prey predominantly on polychaetes, a variety of crustaceans, molluscs, and to a lesser extent echinoderms and fish, feeding by detecting vibrations emitted by their prey. The family is highly important to fisheries throughout the Indo-Pacific, with species such as the northern whiting, Japanese whiting, and King George whiting forming the basis of major fisheries throughout their range. Many species are also of major importance to small subsistence fisheries, while others are little more than occasional bycatch. Smelt-whitings are caught by a number of methods, including trawling, seine nets, and cast nets. In Australia and Japan in particular, members of the family are often highly sought by recreational fishermen who also seek the fish for their prized flesh."

The objective of the operation was to cut the Axis access to the oil wells and fuel processing plants in the Nagykanizsa region west of Lake Balaton for the protection of which the Army Group South force built up three defensive lines behind the natural water obstacle of the Mura river linked to the western shore of the lake. The German reference to this operation is the \""Budapest front\"". The bulk of the forces for the operation consisted of the Bulgarian 1st Army with two Corps composed of six infantry divisions and other smaller units (~100 000 troops) which advanced on the southern flank of the 3rd Ukrainian Front, with the 57th Army positioned to its east (6th Guards Rifle Corps, and 64th and 133rd Rifle Corps), and the other three Armies of the Front concentrated in the area between Lake Balaton and Budapest. The South-western flank was occupied by the Yugoslav partisans. The primary opponents on this sector of the front was the 2nd Panzer Army which included the LXVII and XXII Army Corps.

The Bulgarian 1st Army breached the first two defensive Axis lines and crossed the Mura river. They then assumed a defensive posture at the Veliki Kog-Yastrebtzi line and remained there until 7 May. On 7 May they resumed advance which soon became a pursuit of fleeing enemy and the capture of the remnants of the Wehrmacht and Hungarian troops.

1,48,"The Battle of the 300 Champions, known since Herodotus' day as the Battle of the Champions, was a battle fought in roughly 546 BC between Argos and Sparta. Rather than commit full armies both sides agreed to pitting 300 of their best men against each other. According to Herodotus Sparta had surrounded and captured the plain of Thyrea. When the Argives marched out to defend it, the two armies agreed to let 300 champions from each city fight, with the winner taking the territory. Presumably the idea was to reduce the total number of casualties. Both armies marched home, so as to prevent either side from helping their champions and escalating the duel into a full battle. Neither side would allow for any injured men to be taken. The day called for complete destruction of the enemy force for victory. The two armies were evenly matched and neither could gain the upper hand. They fought until nightfall, and after a bloody battle only three men remained, two Argives and one Spartan. The Argives, Alcenor and Chromius, believing that they had killed all of the Spartans, left the battlefield racing home to Argos to announce their victory. However, they had made one mistake, Orthryades, an injured Spartan had survived. As he was technically the last man standing on the battlefield from either army, he too claimed victory. He survived long enough to tell his baggage handlers of this, and then he committed suicide. By tradition, Othryades, was ashamed to be the only man in his unit to live, and so he killed himself on the field of battle rather than return to Sparta. The reason for the suicide is up for debate, but the act is of great importance. Orthryades did not die by an Argive sword, and the Spartans could always claim that he survived the battle and killed himself in shame, thus gaining an upper hand due to this act of honor. Both sides were able to claim victory: the Argives because more of their champions had survived, and the Spartans because their single champion held the field. Argos did not take too kindly to the Spartans claiming victory and sent their entire hoplite army which was met by a Spartan force of equal magnitude. The Spartans won a decisive victory and as a result gained control of Thyreatis. Pausanias adds that the battle was foretold by the Sibyl, and that the Argives considered themselves the victors and dedicated a bronze sculpture of the Trojan horse at Delphi to commemorate the victory. However, Pausanias says that the sculptor of this horse was Antiphanes of Argos, who dates to ca. 400 BC. Therefore, either Pausanias is mistaken, or he is confusing this with a battle at Thyrea in 424 BC. Years later, in 420 BC during a lull in the Peloponnesian War, Argos challenged Sparta to a rematch of the Battle of the 300 Champions. Sparta declined."
8,57,"Cornu aspersum, known by the common name garden snail, is a species of land snail. As such it is a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusc in the family Helicidae, which include the most commonly familiar land snails. Of all terrestrial molluscs, this species may well be the most widely known. In English texts it was classified under the name Helix aspersa for over two centuries, but the prevailing classification now places it in the genus Cornu. Cornu aspersum is native to the Mediterranean area and western Europe, but whether deliberately or accidentally, humans have spread it to temperate and subtropical areas worldwide. The snail is relished as a food item in some areas, but it is also widely regarded as a pest in gardens and in agriculture, especially in regions where it has been introduced accidentally and where snails are not usually considered to be a menu item. These snails are typically found after it has rained or around twilight. However, during hot weather these hermaphrodites will usually stay hidden. In suburban areas, they can be commonly found feeding in lawns and flower beds after lawn sprinkler systems have soaked these areas with water after sunset."

He participated in 38 Formula One grands prix, debuting on 19 July 1975, but never scored any championship points. Henton (nicknamed \""Superhen\"" in the British racing press) came from a modest council house background and did not start racing until he was 23. On winning the minor British Formula Vee championship in 1971, ever-conscious of the value of public relations, he announced that he was going to be World Champion. This aim eluded him, but he enjoyed a successful career in Formula Three and Formula Two. Henton's F1 debut came in 1975 for Lotus, theoretically a good drive but the team was in turmoil with the Lotus 72 finally uncompetitive and its replacement the Lotus 76 a failure, so nothing concrete was achieved. Between 1975 and 1978 he mixed Formula One and Formula Two drives (including a spell in a private March for his own British F1 Racing team), never quite establishing himself in either category, but clinched the 1980 F2 championship for Toleman, who took him into F1 for 1981. The first Toleman-Hart was something of a disaster, overweight and underdeveloped, and Henton only managed to qualify once. Unfruitful outings for Arrows and Tyrrell in 1982 led to no more success. Perhaps fittingly, his last Formula One outing was at the Race of Champions at Brands Hatch in April 1983, which also turned out to be the last non-championship F1 race in the modern era. Following his retirement from the sport, he returned to running a car dealership and later moved into property development and in recent years has diversified into other areas, notably engineering.

9,47,"Joseph Quick (6 November 1809 Chelsea, London – 30 March 1894 Clapham Park) was an English civil engineer who was closely involved in improvements to water supply in the great industrial cities of the nineteenth century. Both his father and his son (author of The Water Supply of the Metropolis. London and New York: 1880) were also waterworks engineers by the name Joseph Quick. On 28 March 1844, as engineer to the Southwark Waterworks, Quick was called to give evidence before the Health and Towns Commissioners of the British Parliament. Again after the 1848/49 outbreak of cholera in London, he was one of the advisors to the government to improve the London water supply infrastructure. One proposal was to have all intake of water from the Thames moved from the tidal Thames to up-river of Teddington Lock. The expert evidence heard by parliament led to the Metropolis Water Act (1852), as a result of which Quick was entrusted with the building of the new Hampton Waterworks, which he designed in an Italianate style. Even before work at Hampton was complete, contamination of the water supply of the Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company, providing water to the borough of Southwark, Battersea, and other locations in the vicinity, led to the 1853 cholera outbreak. A further cholera outbreak in Soho in 1854 added to the urgency. Both outbreaks were famously studied by Dr John Snow. The company’s new facilities up-river at Hampton (shared with two other water companies) only came into operation in 1855. By 1851 Quick was also consulting engineer to the Grand Junction Waterworks Company. As such he bore responsibility for the water tower constructed in 1857-58 on Campden Hill, of which there is a well-known contemporary print, although he himself was not the designer. In 1857, together with Alexander Fraser, he was granted a patent for “improvements in apparatus for regulating the drawing off and supply of water and other fluids”. Quick’s expertise as a waterworks engineer was such that together with his son he set up an international consultancy, and in the 1860s became involved in projects for the provision of modern water supplies in Amsterdam, Berlin, Saint Petersburg, Antwerp and Beirut. In St Petersburg the open filter method that proved highly successful in Amsterdam turned out to be entirely unsuitable to local climatic conditions."

9,13,"Ned Franklin Garver (born December 25, 1925) is a former American League pitcher who played from 1948 to 1961, winning 129 games in his major league career. Most of his career was spent playing for perennial second-division teams like the St. Louis Browns and Kansas City Athletics. In 1951, Garver had a memorable season pitching for the St. Louis Browns. He compiled a 20-12 record which was noteworthy considering the Browns lost 102 games that year. Garver also posted a 3.73 ERA that season. Out of the Browns' 52 total wins, Garver accounted for nearly 40 percent of them. Garver also led the American League in complete games with 24 and, when he pitched, he often batted sixth in the order rather than the customary ninth, compiling a .305 batting average with one home run. He was also used as a pinch hitter and pinch runner. Garver remains the only pitcher in modern baseball history (post-1920) to win 20 or more games for a team which lost 100 or more games in the same season, and the only pitcher to do so with a winning record. Garver was the starting pitcher for the American League in the 1951 All-Star Game, which was held in Detroit. Following the 1951 season, Browns owner Bill Veeck made Garver the highest paid member of the team with a salary of $25,000.

After Ra'd was shut down by the authorities, he then published another newspaper called Bargh (Lightning), and became active in the Persian Constitutional Revolution.

8,57,"The Javan hawk-eagle (Nisaetus bartelsi) (earlier placed in Spizaetus) is a medium-sized, approximately 60 cm long, dark brown raptor in the family Accipitridae. Its head and neck are rufous and it is heavily barred black below. This majestic and intricately patterned eagle has a long, black crest on its head; this crest is held almost vertically and is tipped with white. The crown is black, topping a chestnut head and nape. The back and wings are dark brown, fading to a lighter brown tail which has wide cream stripes. The throat is creamy white with a black stripe, running to the whitish breast and underparts, which are heavily barred with chestnut. Juvenile birds are similar in colour, but have plainer underparts and a duller head. The sexes are similar. An Indonesian endemic, the Javan hawk-eagle occurs in humid tropical forests of Java. Its range in East Java includes Sempu Island, Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park, Meru Betiri National Park and Alas Purwo National Park. It can also be seen in captivity in zoos like Kebun Binatang Bandung The Javan hawk-eagle is believed to be monogamous. The female usually lays one egg in a nest high on top of a forest tree. The diet consists mainly of birds, lizards, fruit bats and mammals. The Javan hawk-eagle is the national bird of Indonesia, where it is commonly referred to as Garuda, from the bird-like creatures in Hindu and Buddhist myths. The scientific name commemorates the Bartels family, who discovered it. Because of the plumage variability of Spizaetus eagles, the Javan hawk-eagle was not recognised as a full species until 1953. It is one of the rarest raptors. Due to ongoing habitat loss, small population size, limited range and hunting in some areas, it is evaluated as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix II of CITES. In February 2012, there were only around 325 pairs of Javan hawk-eagles living in the wild, mainly in Malangbong, West Java and some in East Java. In Central Java, Mount Merapi has been deforested by eruptions and Dieng Plateau has been deforested by agriculture. The adaptation of the bird is very difficult due to their preference for Rasamala trees and Javanese rats for their diet. Ideally the population should be 1,450 pairs and without conservation the eagle is predicted to go extinct by 2025."

Lvov, an amateur of Rurikid lineage, was a polymath who contributed to geology, history, graphic arts and poetry, but is known primarily as an architect and ethnographer, compiler of the first significant collection of Russian folk songs (the Lvov-Prach collection). Lvov's architecture represented the second, \""strict\"" generation of neoclassicism stylistically close to Giacomo Quarenghi. Lvov worked in Saint Petersburg but his best works survived in the countryside, especially his native Tver Governorate. He redesigned the external appearance of Peter and Paul Fortress and created an unprecedented Trinity Church combining a Roman rotunda with one-of-a-kind pyramidal bell tower. He adapted rammed earth technology to the environment of Northern Russia and used it in his extant Priory Palace in Gatchina; Lvov's construction school, established in 1797, trained over 800 craftsmen. He managed geological surveys and published a treatise on the coals from Donets Basin and Moscow Basin. He experimented with coal pyrolysis, proposed new uses for coal tar and sulphur, and wrote a reference book on heating and ventilation. Lvov designed the badges of the Order of St. Vladimir and the Order of St. Anna, translated works by Anacreon, Palladio, Petrarch, Sappho and the Saga of King Harald into Russian language, wrote libretto for opera and vaudeville, researched Russian chronicles and published one of the first versions of the bylina of Dobrynya Nikitich. In 1783 he became one of the first 36 members of the Russian Academy. In 1931 Vladislav Khodasevich called Lvov \""an intelligent and subtle connoisseur of everything ... who was not destined to do anything remarkable.\"" Later researchers appreciated Lvov's contribution: Richard Taruskin considered Lvov's collection of folk songs \""the greatest and most culturally significant of Russian folk collections\"", Philip Bohlman credited discovery of Russian folk art \""all from the actions of a single individual, Lvov\"", William Craft Brumfield called Lvov \""one of the greatest neoclassical architects produced in the reign of Catherine the Great... neoclassical aesthetics at its purest\""."

Post-progressive draws upon newer developments in popular music and the avant-garde since the mid 1970s. It especially draws from ethnic musics and minimalism, elements which were new to rock music. It is different from neo-progressive rock in that neo-prog pastiches 1970s prog, while \""post-progressive\"" identifies progressive rock music that stems from sources other than prog."
4,45,"Exit is the fourteenth studio album by Italian singer-songwriter Alice, released in 1998 on WEA/Warner Music. After the musically experimental and lyrically introspective albums Mezzogiorno sulle Alpi (1992) and Charade (1995) Alice released Exit in 1998, her most pop-oriented and melodic studio album since the late 1980s. As Allmusic wrote in their review: \""the album often suggests Sarah McLachlan in a duet with Enigma\"". The lead single \""I Am a Taxi\"" was a lyrically minimalistic up-tempo dance groove with influences from contemporary R&B and electronica, and the single included further dancefloor friendly remixes. The second single release, \""Open Your Eyes\"", was an English/Italian language duet with Skye Edwards, lead singer of British electronica and trip hop band Morcheeba, recorded shortly after the release of their 1998 album Big Calm (#18 UK). \""Open Your Eyes\"" was co-written by Alice, producer Francesco Messina, singer-songwriter Juri Camisasca and Peter Hammill of Van der Graaf Generator and was again one of the most accessible and chart-oriented tracks the singer had recorded since Il Sole Nella Pioggia. The promo video showed the two singers performing the song sitting in a rowing boat on a sunny summer's day in London's Hyde Park. Third single \""Dimmi Di Sì\"" (\""Tell Me Yes\"") was a midtempo ballad which juxtaposed subtle club beats and ambient keyboard effects against acoustic guitars. Exit also included a second duet between Alice and Italian alternative rock band Bluvertigo's Morgan, \""L'immagine\"" (\""The Images\""), and the two were to duet again on both Personal Jukebox in 2000 and Viaggio in Italia in 2003. The one-minute-eighteen-second \""Il cielo sopra il cielo\"" was an excerpt from the ambient/crossover group project Devogue's eponymous 1997 debut album, a forty-five-minute sound collage which had featured vocals by Alice on five of the thirteen titles. The acoustic track \""1943\"", written by Alice's longtime collaborator Mino di Martino, and lyrically influenced by the works of German poet and playwright Else Lasker-Schüler, draws parallels between the horrors of the Holocaust and the at the time on-going war in The Balkans, and its so called ethnic cleansing. When playing the song live on the following Exit tour Alice specifically urged her audiences to donate money to organisations helping refugees from the former Yugoslavia coming to Italy. She later also performed the song in Italian manifestations against the Iraq War. Exit closes with a cover version of French poet, composer, singer and musician Léo Ferré's \""L'Étranger\"" (\""The Stranger\""), a poem by Charles Baudelaire set to music by Ferré and first released on his 1967 album Léo Ferré Chante Baudelaire. Both the \""I Am A Taxi\"" and \""Open Your Eyes\"" singles included the non-album track \""Da Lontano\"". Both \""Open Your Eyes\"" and \""Dimmi Di Sì\"" were later included in the 2000 career retrospective Personal Jukebox."

He beat some world champions: Vasily Smyslov at the Moscow Spartakiad 1974, Tal at Sochi 1970, and a young Garry Kasparov at the 1978 Soviet Championship. Tseshkovsky himself almost qualified for the World Championship candidates matches when he finished fourth in the 1976 Manila Interzonal, one place lower than was needed to progress to the next stage. At the 27th Chess Olympiad in 1986, he scored 2½/5 as the second reserve board to help the USSR team win the gold medal. His 6/9 result in Saint Petersburg, 2004 qualified Tseshkovsky to play in the Russian Championship final later in the year, alongside Russia's seven top players (including Garry Kasparov who won) and five other qualifiers. In 2008 he tied for first with Farrukh Amonatov and Anton Filippov in the Georgy Agzamov Memorial tournament in Tashkent. In the following year he took clear first place in the same tournament. Tseshkovsky won the European Senior Chess Championship in 2009 and 2010.In 2010, he also tied for 2nd-4th with Algimantas Butnorius and Nikolai Pushkov in the European Seniors’ Rapid Championship. In the opening, his choice was 1.e4 with the white pieces. With Black he played the Ruy Lopez, Sicilian Defence, Pirc Defence and Modern Defence against 1.e4, and against 1.d4 he most often played the Grünfeld Defence and Benko Gambit. Tseshkovsky maintained a high standard of chess throughout his career, registering his highest Elo rating of 2600 in October 2005.

8,57,"The brown-headed honeyeater (Melithreptus brevirostris) is a species of passerine bird in the Meliphagidae family.It is endemic to Australia. Its natural habitats are temperate forests and Mediterranean-type shrubby vegetation. The brown-headed honeyeater was first described by Vigors & Horsfield in 1827. Its species name is derived from the Latin terms brevis \""short\"", and rostrum \""beak\"". Five subspecies have been described. The race magnirostris from Kangaroo Island has a noticeably larger bill. It is a member of the genus Melithreptus with several species, of similar size and all black-headed apart from this species, in the honeyeater family Meliphagidae. Molecular markers show the brown-headed honeyeater is most closely related to the black-chinned honeyeater, with the strong-billed honeyeater an earlier offshoot between 6.7 and 3.4 million years ago. A small honeyeater ranging from 13 to 15 cm (5.2–6 in) in length, it is olive brown above and buff below, with a brown head, nape and throat, with a cream or orange patch of bare skin over the eye and a white crescent-shaped patch on the nape. The legs and feet are orange. It makes a scratchy chwik-chwik-chwik call. The brown-headed honeyeater ranges from central-southern Queensland, down through central and eastern New South Wales (though generally west of the Great Dividing Range), across Victoria and into eastern South Australia, where it is found in the Flinders Ranges and around the lower Murray River region. It occurs in southern Western Australia. Insects form the bulk of the diet, and like its close relatives the black-chinned and strong-billed honeyeaters, the brown-headed honeyeater forages by probing in bark of trunks and branches of trees. Brown-headed honeyeaters may nest from July to December, breeding once or twice during this time. The nest is a thick-walled bowl of grasses and bits of bark lined with softer plant material hidden in the outer foliage of a tall tree, usually a eucalypt. Two or three eggs are laid, 16 x 13 mm and shiny buff-pink sparsely spotted with red-brown (more on larger end)."

Perhaps the major reason for the Republican defeat was the fallout from the Army-McCarthy Hearings, in which prominent Republican Senator Joe McCarthy accused countless political and intellectual figures of having Communist ties, usually with no evidence. Another issue was the Dixon-Yates contract to supply power to the Atomic Energy Commission. Sam Rayburn of Texas became Speaker of the House, exchanging places with new Minority Leader Joseph W.

4,22,"\""I Do\"" was the Maltese entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006, performed in English by Fabrizio Faniello. The song is an up-tempo number, in which Faniello tells his lover that \""I love you like a fool\"", despite the fact that their relationship has ostensibly ended. He tells her that \""I won't give you up, I'll never stop\"" and that he is \""Waiting for the day when I hear you say/Our love is here to stay\"". The video plays up this angle further, as it features a split-screen story in which Faniello and his former lover going through their day and doing much the same thing at much the same time while coming to the realisation that their relationship should not have ended. They both leave their houses to see each other, only to arrive at each other's now-empty house. Disconsolate, they both sit down and attempt to call each other and receive no answer. Faniello then throws his phone down beside him, only for it to hit his former lover - which results in the split screen breaking and the pair reuniting. As Malta had finished the 2005 Contest in second place, the song was pre-qualified for the final. Here, it was performed seventh, following Spain's Las Ketchup with \""Un Blodymary\"" and preceding Germany's Texas Lightning with \""No No Never\"". At the close of voting, it had received 1 point (from Albania), placing 24th (last) in a field of 24 and thus requiring Malta to qualify through the semi-final at their next Contest appearance. Reports also surfaced of tensions between members of the Maltese delegation on the flight back to Valletta. The poor result is claimed to be as a result of the performance, in which Faniello and his backing vocalist (Alexandros Panayi) appeared to sing in different keys and frequently miss notes. South African boy band Hi-5 recorded an Afrikaans cover of the song, titled \""Vergewe My Weer\"". It was succeeded as Maltese representative at the 2007 Contest by Olivia Lewis with \""Vertigo\""."

7,12,"Mainz Cathedral or St. Martin's Cathedral (German: Mainzer Dom, Martinsdom or, officially, Der Hohe Dom zu Mainz) is located near the historical center and pedestrianized market square of the city of Mainz, Germany. This 1000-year-old Roman Catholic cathedral is the site of the episcopal see of the Bishop of Mainz. Mainz Cathedral is predominantly Romanesque in style, but later exterior additions over many centuries have resulted in the appearance of various architectural influences seen today. It comprises three naves and stands under the patronage of Saint Martin of Tours. The eastern quire is dedicated to Saint Stephen. The interior of the cathedral houses tombs and funerary monuments of former powerful Electoral-prince-archbishops, or Kurfürst-Erzbischöfe, of the diocese and contains religious works of art spanning a millennium. The cathedral also has a central courtyard and statues of Saint Boniface and The Madonna on its grounds. During Willigis' time, the city of Mainz flourished economically. Willigis became one of the most influential politicians of that time, he even was regent of the empire between 991 and 994. He ordered the construction of a new cathedral in the pre-Romanesque Ottonian architecture. This new and impressive building was part of Willigis's vision of Mainz as the \""second Rome\"". This new cathedral was to take over the functions of two churches: the old cathedral and St. Alban's, which was the largest church in the area, belonging to a Benedictine abbey and serving as the burial ground for the bishops and other nobles, including Fastrada, a spouse of Charlemagne. Most of the synods and other important meetings were held at St. Alban's Abbey. The new cathedral consisted of a double chancel with two transepts. The main hall was built in the typical triple-nave \""cross\"" pattern. As was usual at that time no vault was included because of structural difficulties relating to the size of the building. Six towers rose from the church. A cloister was enclosed in the structure and a small freestanding church, St. Mary's Church, connected by a colonnade. This small church developed later into the collegiate church of St. Maria ad Grada. Sandstone was used as the primary building material for the cathedral. The inside was plastered white under the Archbishop Bardo, probably in the middle of the 10th century. During renovations ordered by Henry IV in the late 11th century, much of the outside was also plastered, but the cornices were left exposed in their original red and yellow. It is believed that the coloring of the cathedral was changed more times, but no further documentation of the coloring is available until record of the Baroque works. The cathedral suffered extensive damage from a fire on the day of its inauguration in 1009. Archbishop Bardo (Bardo of Oppertshafen) presided over the completion of the cathedral begun under Willigis. By 1037 the main portions of the body of Mainz Cathedral were complete. Willigis was buried in the second church he had initiated, St. Stephan's, in 1011."
4,45,"Tha Carter IV is the ninth studio album by American rapper Lil Wayne, released on August 29, 2011 through Young Money Entertainment, Cash Money Records and Universal Republic Records. Recording sessions for the album began in late 2008, shortly after Lil Wayne's sixth studio album, Tha Carter III (2008) was released to strong sales and critical acclaim: however, the sessions were put on hold, as Lil Wayne claimed he did not want to follow an album he held in high regard so quickly with another, potentially inferior release. In the interim, Lil Wayne released his two other albums in 2010: the largely rock-themed Rebirth, and I Am Not a Human Being. The latter was reportedly composed from unreleased material from the original Tha Carter IV sessions, as the album was released whilst Wayne served a prison sentence at Rikers Island prison for illegal possession of a weapon, and was thus unable to record any new material: this also meant Tha Carter IV's recording sessions were once more put on hold. Following Wayne's release from prison, the album was re-recorded from scratch. The recording sessions resumed at various locations, involving several record producers including Bangladesh, Detail, T-Minus, Noah \""40\"" Shebib, Polow da Don, Jim Jonsin, Kane Beatz, Boi-1da, Willy Will, Streetrunner, Cool & Dre, Young Ladd, The Smeezingtons, and Kanye West. The album's largely concerns the themes of sex, violence, drugs and crime, but also love, hurt and emotional conflict. Appearances on the album include Cory Gunz, Drake, T-Pain, Tech N9ne, Andre 3000, Rick Ross, John Legend, Bruno Mars, Birdman, Kevin Rudolf, Jadakiss, Bun B, Nas, Shyne, and Busta Rhymes. Following a heavily delayed release, Tha Carter IV was released to digital retailers at midnight on August 28, 2011, following Wayne's scheduled performance at the MTV Video Music Awards, and physical retailers received the album the following day. Tha Carter IV achieved first week sales of 964,000 copies in the United States and became Lil Wayne's second album to top the US Billboard 200 in its first week. The album received generally mixed reviews from music critics, who were divided in their responses towards the album's production and Wayne's own performances on the album: they felt it a disappointment compared to his previous work. The entire album according to Lil Wayne is an allegory of the negative aspects of the West."

1,10,"The 1965 PGA Championship was the 47th PGA Championship, played August 12–15 at Laurel Valley Golf Club in Ligonier, Pennsylvania, a suburb southeast of Pittsburgh. Dave Marr won his only major championship, two strokes ahead of runners-up Billy Casper and Jack Nicklaus. Marr was the co-leader after 54 holes with Tommy Aaron, a stroke ahead of Gardner Dickinson and two shots ahead of major champions Nicklaus and Casper. Aaron shot 78 and Dickinson 74 on Sunday, while Marr matched an even-par 71 with Nicklaus and Casper. Not far from his hometown of Latrobe, Laurel Valley was co-founded by Arnold Palmer in 1959, who had another disappointing major in his home state and finished 14 strokes back, tied for 33rd. Three years earlier, he lost an 18-hole playoff to Nicklaus in the U.S. Open at Oakmont near Pittsburgh, then finished tied for 17th five weeks later at the PGA Championship at Aronimink, outside Philadelphia. (Palmer won the other two majors of 1962, the Masters and the Open Championship, but never won the PGA Championship for a career grand slam.) After the practice rounds, a 60-foot (18 m) fir tree was installed on the par-5 third hole to prevent corner-cutting from the tee to an adjacent fairway, over the objections of the club professional. This was the final PGA Championship appearance for two-time champion Ben Hogan, age 53, who tied for 15th place. After his near-fatal auto accident in early 1949, Hogan's legs could not withstand the grueling match play schedule and he did not play again in the championship until it became a stroke play event.

7,23,"Ulugh Muztagh or Ulugh Muztag (Uighur: Ulug muz tag) (simplified Chinese: 乌鲁木孜塔格; traditional Chinese: 烏魯木孜塔格; pinyin: Wūlǔ Mùzītǎgé) and Muztag Feng (Chinese: 木孜塔格峰; pinyin: Mùzītǎgé Fēng), is an extremely remote mountain group on the northern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Located on the border between the Tibetan Autonomous Region and Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, it is part of the main range of the Kunlun Mountains of East-Central Asia. For a long time its elevation was thought to be as high as 7,723 metres, but it was measured by a 1985 Sino-American first ascent expedition, who established its true elevation of 6,973 m, which has since been confirmed by SRTM data and modern high resolution Chinese topographic mapping. The subsidiary West Peak was climbed by a Finnish expedition in 2003 and a height of 6925 metres was confirmed for Ulugh Muztagh II. There have been only a few attempts to climb Ulugh Muztagh and several of them have not been even able to reach the foot of the mountain. Getting near the mountain requires a difficult drive across largely unpassabe terrain at the elevation of 4300–5000 metres. Expeditions who have climbed the mountain spent 2 to 3 weeks on the approach alone using 4 or 6 wheel drive vehicles. The 7,723 metre elevation claim was made by the English country gentleman and explorer St George Littledale in 1895. Despite the fact that earlier explorers had put forward elevations several hundred metres lower, and the scientific 6,973 metre measurement made in 1985, the Littledale elevation has been so resilient that even into the 21st century it still remains the most widely quoted; it is found in generally reliable publications, including the Times Atlas and fact books. Other remote Tibetan-related mountains whose elevations have been established by SRTM and modern Chinese mapping include: \n*  Nganglong (Aling) Kangri, 32°48′30″N 81°00′03″E﻿ / ﻿32.80833°N 81.00083°E, 6,720 m, but still often quoted at 7,315 m  \n*  Amne Machin (Maqen Gangri), 34°47′54″N 99°27′45″E﻿ / ﻿34.79833°N 99.46250°E, 6,282 m, but still often quoted at 7,160 m \n*  Bukadaban Feng, 36°01′27″N 90°51′57″E﻿ / ﻿36.02417°N 90.86583°E, 6,860 m, but still quoted much higher \n*  Zangser Kangri , 34°23′39″N 85°51′00″E﻿ / ﻿34.39417°N 85.85000°E, 6,540 m, but still sometimes quoted at 6,940 m.

9,34,"David Padilla Arancibia (13 August 1927 – 25 September 2016) was a military general and de facto president of Bolivia. He ruled his country from November 1978 to August 1979. A native of Sucre, Padilla was born on 13 August 1927. Joining the armed forces, he rose to the post of Commander of the Army. He was serving in that capacity when he deposed the also de facto government of General Juan Pereda on 24 November 1978. Pereda had taken the presidency in July of the same year simply because it was available to him, many military leaders having grown tired of the constant manipulations of dictator Hugo Banzer for his personal political ends. Padilla, in contrast, came to power as the leader of a group of democratically-oriented officers committed to returning the country to democratic rule in as short a period of time as possible. His goal was simple: to transfer power to whoever won the upcoming presidential elections and effect a retreat of the military to its barracks and posts of operation, where they belonged. For this reason, Padilla was remarkably popular during his short (nine-month) stay at the Palacio Quemado. The general election of 1 July 1979, on the other hand, turned out to be a fiasco. The leftist candidate Hernán Siles finished first at the polls, but without attaining the 50% majority necessary for direct election. Thus, it was left to Congress to determine the next Chief Executive, as stipulated in the Constitution. To the surprise of many, Congress could not agree on any candidate, no matter how many votes were taken. Positions hardened, and no solution seemed possible, until an alternative was offered in the form of the President of the Senate, Wálter Guevara, who was named President for one year pending the calling of new elections in 1980. Padilla duly transferred power to Guevara on 8 August 1979, as he had promised he would. He left the governing palace as an almost universally respected former de facto military leader — a rarity indeed in the history of Bolivia. Padilla died in La Paz on 25 September 2016, at the age of 89."

1,48,"The parliamentary election in South Africa on 26 May 1948 represented a turning point in the country's history. The United Party, which had led the government since its foundation in 1933, and its leader, incumbent Prime Minister Jan Smuts, were ousted by the Reunited National Party (Herenigde Nasionale Party in Afrikaans), led by Daniel Francois Malan, a Dutch Reformed cleric. During the election battle, both the UP and the NP formed coalitions with smaller parties. The UP was aligned with the left-leaning Labour Party, while the Afrikaner Party sought to advance Afrikaner rights by allying with the HNP. By legislation relating to franchise requirements, very few people of Coloured and Asian descent were able to vote in this election; Africans had been banned altogether since the late 1930s, with the limited number of Africans meeting electoral qualifications voting for four \""own\"" white MPs separately. The HNP, realizing that many White South Africans felt threatened by black political aspirations, pledged to implement a policy of strict racial segregation in all spheres of living. The Nationalists labelled this new system of social organisation \""apartheid\"" (\""apartness\"" or \""separation\""), the name by which it became universally known. The HNP also took advantage of white fear of black-on-white crime, and the HNP promised whites safety and security from black-on-white crime and violence which was widespread then as it is today. In contrast to the HNP's consistent, straightforward platform, the UP supported vague notions of slowly integrating the different racial groups within South Africa. Furthermore, white dissatisfaction with domestic and economic problems in South Africa after World War II, the NP's superior organization, and electoral gerrymandering, all proved to be significant challenges to the UP campaign."

It is the most important extra-parliamentary independentist party in Catalonia.

In 2010, Reagrupament negotiated an electoral alliance with the Catalan Solidarity for Independence, led by Joan Laporta.

Link River Dam's reservoir, Klamath Lake, has a capacity of 873,000 acre feet (1.077×109 m3). The project provides flood control, generates hydro power, and stores most of the water used for irrigation in the Klamath Reclamation Project.

1,48,"The invasion of Yugoslavia, also known as the April War (Slovene: Aprilska vojna, Serbian Latin: Aprilski rat, Croatian: Travanjski rat) or Operation 25, was a German-led attack on the Kingdom of Yugoslavia by the Axis powers which began on 6 April 1941 during World War II. The order for the invasion was put forward in \""Führer Directive No. 25\"", which Adolf Hitler issued on 27 March 1941, following the Yugoslav coup d'état. The invasion commenced with an overwhelming air attack on Belgrade and facilities of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force (VVKJ) by the Luftwaffe (German Air Force) and attacks by German land forces from southwestern Bulgaria. These attacks were followed by German thrusts from Romania, Hungary and the Ostmark. Italian forces were limited to air and artillery attacks until 11 April, when the Italian army attacked towards Ljubljana (in modern-day Slovenia) and through Istria and Lika and down the Dalmatian coast. On the same day, Hungarian forces entered Yugoslav Bačka and Baranya, but like the Italians they faced practically no resistance. A Yugoslav attack into the northern parts of the Italian protectorate of Albania met with initial success, but was inconsequential due to the collapse of the rest of the Yugoslav forces. The invasion ended when an armistice was signed on 17 April 1941, based on the unconditional surrender of the Royal Yugoslav Army, which came into effect at noon on 18 April. Yugoslavia was then occupied and partitioned by the Axis powers. Some areas of Yugoslavia were annexed by neighboring Axis countries, some areas remained occupied, and in other areas Axis puppet states such as the Independent State of Croatia (Serbo-Croatian: Nezavisna Država Hrvatska, or NDH) were created. Along with Italy's stalled invasion of Greece on 28 October 1940, and the German-led invasion of Greece (Operation Marita) and invasion of Crete (Operation Merkur), the invasion of Yugoslavia was part of the German Balkan Campaign (German: Balkanfeldzug)."

6,35,"The original Ford Cologne V6 is a series of 60° cast iron block V6 engines produced continuously by the Ford Motor Company in Cologne, Germany since 1965. Along with the British Ford Essex V6 engine and the U.S. GMC Truck V6 these were among the first mass produced V6 engines in the world. Throughout its production run, the Cologne V6 has evolved from the engine displacements of 1.8, 2.0, 2.3, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8, 2.9 and 4.0 litres engines. All except the Cosworth 24v derivative and later 4.0 litre SOHC engines were pushrod overhead-valve engines, with a single camshaft between the banks. Originally, the Cologne V6 was installed in vehicles intended for Germany and continental Europe, while the British \""Essex\"" V6 was used in cars for the British market. The Cologne and the Essex engines were not related at all. Later, the Cologne V6 largely replaced the Essex V6 for British-market vehicles. These engines were also used in the United States, especially in compact trucks. The Cologne V6 was made to be very compatible in installation with the Taunus V4, having the same transmission bolt pattern, the same engine mounts, and in many versions, a cylinder head featuring \""siamesed\"" exhaust passages, which reduced the three exhaust outlets down to two on each side. The latter feature was great for compatibility, but poor for performance. The 2.4, 2.9 and 4.0 had three exhaust ports, making them preferable. The engine was available in both carburetted and fuel injected form."

7,39,"129 Antigone is a large main-belt asteroid. Radar observations indicate that it is composed of almost pure nickel-iron. It and other similar asteroids probably originate from the core of a shattered Vesta-like planetesimal which had a differentiated interior. It was discovered by German-American astronomer C. H. F. Peters on February 5, 1873, and named after Antigone, the Theban princess in Greek mythology. In 1979 a possible satellite of Antigone was suggested based on lightcurve data. A model constructed from these shows Antigone itself to be quite regularly shaped. In 1990, the asteroid was observed from the Collurania-Teramo Observatory, allowing a composite light curve to be produced that showed a rotation period of 4.9572 ± 0.0001 hours and a brightness variation of 0.34 ± 0.01 in magnitude. The ratio of the lengths of the major to minor axes for this asteroid were found to be 1.45 ±0.02. 10µ radiometric data collected from Kitt Peak in 1975 gave a diameter estimate of 114 km. Since 1985, a total of three stellar occultations by Antigone have been observed.

The Norsjø–Skien Canal, with locks in Skien and Løveid, was built in 1854–1861 and linked Skien with Norsjø lake. The longer Bandak–Nordsjø Canal was opened in 1892 by the Minister of Labour Hans Hein Theodor Nysom. It extended the canal from Norsjø lake through Flåvatn and Kviteseidvatn (Kviteseidvatnet) lakes to Bandak lake. In Europe, this canal was seen as \""the eighth wonder\"" at the time it was finished. The Bandak–Nordsjø Canal was mainly built for transport of goods and passengers, log floating and to prevent flooding. Log floating is no longer practiced, due to the closing of Union, a local paper factory. An eastern section gives access from Norsjø lake to Notodden via Lake Heddalsvatnet.

1,48,"The First Battle of Kiev was the German name for the operation that resulted in a very large encirclement of Soviet troops in the vicinity of Kiev during World War II. This encirclement is considered the largest encirclement in the history of warfare (by number of troops). The operation ran from 7 August to 26 September 1941 as part of Operation Barbarossa, the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union. In Soviet military history, it is referred to as the Kiev Strategic Defensive Operation, with somewhat different dating of 7 July – 26 September 1941. Nearly the entire Southwestern Front of the Red Army was encircled. However, the Kiev encirclement was not complete, and small groups of Red Army troops managed to escape the cauldron days after the German pincers met east of the city, including the headquarters of Marshal Semyon Budyonny, Marshal Semyon Timoshenko and Commissar Nikita Khrushchev. The commander of the Southwestern Front—Mikhail Kirponos—was trapped behind enemy lines and killed while trying to break through. The disaster of the battle was an unprecedented defeat for the Red Army, exceeding even the Minsk tragedy of June–July 1941.

Caesar entered Magdalen College, Oxford, aged 12 in 1602, and was a fellow of All Souls from 1605 to 1611. He was incorporated at Cambridge with a LL.B. in 1609, but continued at Oxford, where he was made Doctor of Civil and Canon Law in 1612. In 1611 he joined the Middle Temple and began to practice in the ecclesiastical courts; he was knighted in 1613, and served as MP for Weymouth in the Addled Parliament of 1614. In 1615 he was appointed a master in chancery, no doubt through the influence of his father, and continued in this post until 1639; he was also from before 1626 a judge of the Court of Audience and Master of the Faculties, both appointments which held until his death. In 1639 the Mastership of the Rolls became vacant on the death of Sir Dudley Digges, and Caesar consulted Archbishop Laud on whether he might obtain it, but was warned \""that as things then stood, the place was not like to go without more money than he thought any wise man would give for it\"". Caesar, perhaps more ambitious than wise, apparently paid the King £15,000 in a lump sum with a further £2,000 loan, and was duly appointed. Foss in his Lives of the Judges comments that \""It is difficult to regret that he did not live long enough to profit by this iniquitous traffic of the judicial seat, as disgraceful to one party as the other\"". He had made little mark through his tenure of the post when his family was struck down by smallpox in November 1642: one of his daughters died on 2 November, he himself did so on 6 December 1642 (even though, as he declared in the will he made on his death-bed, he had already had the disease as a younger man), and his eldest son, Julius, followed five days later.

Set for a launch in the 2020s (around 2022), the spacecraft are being developed to study the Galilean moon Europa through a lander and a series of flybys while in orbit around Jupiter. The mission is a follow-up to studies made by the Galileo spacecraft during its eight years in Jupiter orbit, which indicated the existence of a subsurface ocean underneath Europa. Plans to send a spacecraft to Europa were initially conceived with projects such as Europa Orbiter and Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter, in which a spacecraft would be injected into orbit around Europa. However, due to the strong impact of radiation from Jupiter's magnetosphere in Europan orbit, it was decided that it would be safer to inject a spacecraft into an orbit around Jupiter and make several close flybys of the moon instead. The mission was originally branded the Europa Clipper mission, and began as a joint investigation between the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Applied Physics Laboratory. The Europa Mission orbiter will be built and manufactured with a scientific payload of nine instruments, contributed by the JPL, APL, Southwest Research Institute, University of Texas, Arizona State University and University of Colorado Boulder.

9,47,"Henry of Burgundy (c. 1035 – January 27, 1070/1074), called the Gallant (le Damoiseau), was the eldest surviving son and heir of Robert I, Duke of Burgundy and his wife, Helie of Semur, and a grandson of King Robert II of France, thus making him a member of the House of Capet through its Burgundy cadet branch. Little is known about his life and he died shortly before his father, and thus was never duke himself. Two of his sons became dukes in succession after his father's death, while a third son became Count of Portugal through his marriage to Theresa, daughter of King Alfonso VI of León and Castile. The name of Henry's wife is not known, though both Sibylla and Clémence have been suggested. The first of these derives from an undated obituary from Besançon, Sainte-Etienne, naming \""Sibilla, mater ducus Burgundie\"" (Sibylla, mother of the Duke of Burgundy), it being reasoned that since she is not called duchess, she must have been married to the sole father of a duke who was not a duke himself, Henry. However it has been argued by Jean Richard that this is a reference to Sibylla of Burgundy, Duchess of Burgundy, mother of the then-ruling duke, Hugh II. Richard proposed based on the the name's repeated use among the descendants of her son Odo I, Duke of Burgundy that she may have been named Clémence, although Odo's wife had a sister, Clementia of Burgundy, who could have been the inspiration for its use among their descendants. Based on the use of the byname Borel by Odo I, genealogist Szabolcs de Vajay proposed that his mother was the daughter of Berenguer Ramon I, Count of Barcelona and his third wife, Guisle of Lluca, and hence granddaughter of count Ramon Borrell, although there is no documentary evidence that this was the case.

William's father, William III, abdicated to the abbey of Saint-Cyprien in Poitiers and left the government to Fierebras. His mother was Gerloc, the daughter of Duke Rollo of Normandy. His sister was Adelaide, wife of Hugh Capet, the king against whom William later battled for his duchy. His early reign was characterised by many wars. He fought frequently against the counts of Anjou, the first time against Geoffrey Greymantle, who had taken Loudun. In 988, he went to war with the newly elected king of France, Hugh Capet, whom he refused to recognise. Capet had been granted Aquitaine by King Lothair before the latter had been reconciled to William's father. Capet renewed his claim on the great duchy and invaded it that year. A royal army was defeated on the plain of the Loire Valley. William sheltered the young Louis, the son of Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine, the last legitimate Carolingian heir. He opened the palace of Poitiers to him and treated him as royalty, regarding him as the true heir to the French throne. In 968, he married Emma or Emmeline, daughter of Theobald I of Blois and Luitgarde of Vermandois. Their marriage was stormy, in part because of William's indulgence in the pursuit of women and, a hunting aficionado, wild animals. She banished his paramours, they separated twice for long periods, and finally he retired to a monastery, as his father had done, leaving Emma to rule Aquitaine in the name of their son William until 1004. Their second son, Ebles, died sometime after 997."

1,48,"The Battle of Kalavrye (also Kalavryai or Kalavryta) was fought in 1078 between the Byzantine imperial forces of general (and future emperor) Alexios Komnenos and the rebellious governor of Dyrrhachium, Nikephoros Bryennios the Elder. Bryennios had rebelled against Michael VII Doukas (r. 1071–78) and had won over the allegiance of the Byzantine army's regular regiments in the Balkans. Even after Doukas's overthrow by Nikephoros III Botaneiates (r. 1078–81), Bryennios continued his revolt, and threatened Constantinople. After failed negotiations, Botaneiates sent the young general Alexios Komnenos with whatever forces he could gather to confront him. The two armies clashed at Kalavrye on the Halmyros river in what is now European Turkey. Alexios Komnenos, whose army was considerably smaller and far less experienced, tried to ambush Bryennios's army. The ambush failed, and the wings of his own army were driven back by the rebels. Alexios barely managed to break through with his personal retinue, but succeeded in regrouping his scattered men. At the same time, and despite having seemingly won the battle, Bryennios's army fell into disorder after its own Pecheneg allies attacked its camp. Reinforced by Turkish mercenaries, Alexios lured the troops of Bryennios into another ambush through a feigned retreat. The rebel army broke and Bryennios was captured. The battle is known through two detailed accounts, Anna Komnene's Alexiad, and her husband Nikephoros Bryennios the Younger's Material for History, on which Anna's own account relies to a large degree. It is one of the few Byzantine battles described in detail, and hence a valuable source for studying the tactics of the Byzantine army of the late 11th century."

The song was composed by Serge Gainsbourg, who previously had written France Gall's winning entry \""Poupée de cire, poupée de son\"" in 1965, representing Luxembourg. Gainsbourg would also go on to write Joëlle Ursull's entry for France, \""White and Black Blues\"", which finished 2nd in 1990. \""Boum Badadoum\"" is part of the long Eurovision tradition of nonsensical titles and lyrics. However, instead of the usual Eurovision cannons of love and happiness associated with the genre, Barelli instead asks to be allowed to live a full life before she is killed in a bomb attack. In this regard, the song could actually regarded as critical of the normal nonsensical \""boom-boom\"" lyrics of Eurovision entries. The phrases \""boum-badaboum\"" and \""boum boum\"" and a countdown are repeated throughout the lyrics. Barelli recorded the song in four languages; French, English, German, and Italian - all versions with the same title. The song was performed fourteenth on the night, following Norway's Kirsti Sparboe with \""Dukkemann\"" and preceding Yugoslavia's Lado Leskovar with \""Vse rože sveta\"".

8,57,"The Atlantic tarpon (Megalops atlanticus) inhabits coastal waters, estuaries, lagoons, and rivers. Tarpons feed almost exclusively on schooling fish and occasionally crabs. A tarpon is capable of filling its swim bladder with air, like a primitive lung. This gives the tarpon a predatory advantage when oxygen levels in the water are low. Tarpons have been recorded at up to 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in) in length and weighing up to 161 kg (355 lb). The Atlantic tarpon is also known as the silver king. In appearance, tarpons are greenish or bluish on top and silver on the sides. The large mouth is turned upwards and the lower jaw contains an elongated, bony plate. The last ray of the dorsal fin is much longer than the others, reaching nearly to the tail. The Atlantic tarpon is found in the Atlantic Ocean, typically in tropical and subtropical regions, though it has been reported as far north as Nova Scotia and the Atlantic coast of southern France, and as far south as Argentina. As with all Elopiformes, it is found in coastal areas; it spawns at sea. Its diet includes small fish and crustaceans. The tarpon is the official state saltwater fish of Alabama."

9,6,"Benjamin John Plunket was a 20th-century Anglican bishop. Plunket was the son of William Plunket, 4th Baron Plunket, and Ann Lee Guinness (sister of the Lord Ardilaun). Born in Bray on 1 August 1870, he was educated at Harrow and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. Ordained in 1896, he began his career with a curacy at St Peter's Phibsboro. He was then Rector of Aghade with Ardoyne and subsequently Vicar of St Ann’s, Dublin. In 1913 he became Bishop of Tuam, Killala and Achonry, and in 1919 was translated to Meath. He retired in 1925, and died on 26 January 1947. The Irish Times, when reporting his death, characterised Plunket as ‘a Churchman of broad views … [who] was not afraid to utter his opinions’. Probably his most notable stand was in 1910 when, on the accession of King George V, parliament passed an act to delete terms offensive to Roman Catholics from the Royal Accession Declaration. The old Declaration, introduced in 1678, repudiated the Mass, transubstantiation and the invocation of the Virgin Mary and the saints. The modified form of the Declaration was widely opposed, but Plunket was the principal promoter of a petition to the House of Commons in support of it, signed by over 3,000 representative Irish Protestants. On another occasion, he was one of three Church of Ireland bishops who, with eighteen Catholic bishops, signed a controversial anti-partition manifesto issued before the Longford by-election of May 1917; the manifesto was a significant factor in Sinn Fein’s narrow victory in the by-election. Plunket was also an Irish language enthusiast, encouraging Irish in Church of Ireland schools and hymns in Irish at church services. In 1925, while still Bishop of Meath, he was severely criticised by W.B. Yeats in the latter’s famous speech in the Senate on divorce. Plunket’s uncompromising approach to sexual morality and the indissolubility of marriage had, as Yeats saw it, given succour to those intent on passing legislation which the Protestant minority would find oppressive. Shortly afterwards, he resigned as Bishop of Meath on health grounds when aged 55. He was left the St. Anne's Park estate in Raheny in Dublin, formerly the residence of his uncle Lord Ardilaun, following the death of Lady Ardilaun, in 1937 due to the cost of the estate he sold it to Dublin Corporation, keeping Sybil Hill and 30 acres as his residence, his former residence is now St. Paul's College, Raheny. In 1900 he married Susan Butler (1874-1936), the daughter of Sir Thomas Butler, 10th Bt. Their daughter Olive married Peter Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, 8th Earl Fitzwilliam in 1933."

1,69,"The 1999 European Grand Prix (formally the XLIII Warsteiner Grand Prix d'Europe) was a Formula One motor race held on 26 September 1999 at the Nürburgring in Nürburg, Germany. It was the fourteenth race of the 1999 Formula One season. The 66-lap race was won by Johnny Herbert driving for the Stewart team. Jarno Trulli finished second for the Prost team with Rubens Barrichello third in the other Stewart car. It was considered to be one of the most eventful and exciting races of the 1999 season. Going into the race Mika Häkkinen, Eddie Irvine, Heinz-Harald Frentzen and David Coulthard were all harbouring World Championship aspirations. Häkkinen and Irvine were tied for the points lead, with Frentzen 10 points behind them and Coulthard a further two points back. The previous round at Monza had seen Häkkinen make an unforced error while leading, Coulthard and Irvine finished only 5th and 6th and Frentzen took his second race win of the season. Marc Gené's performance in the race is seen by many as the defining moment of the 1999 World Driver's Championship race, with Ferrari's Eddie Irvine unable to pass him for 6th place, the extra point, which could have given the Irishman the championship that year. (Had Irvine scored this point, it is widely believed that Michael Schumacher would have allowed Irvine to take second place from him in the Japanese Grand Prix later in the year, giving Irvine an overall lead of one point in the final standings.) Due to the high number of retirements, the Stewart cars prevailed enormously, with Prost's Jarno Trulli taking an unlikely second. This resulted in the podium consisting of constructors named after former Formula 1 World Champions. As a consequence of the race, Häkkinen extended his lead in the World Drivers' Championship to two points over Irvine, with Frenzen a further twelve behind. In the World Constructors Championship, McLaren extended their lead to twelve points over Ferrari."

Three of the superfamilies in this clade are among those Acarina collectively called feather mites, whereas the fourth and fifth – Psoroptoidea and Pyroglyphoidea – contains ear mites and scabies mites among others."

9,7,"America's Store was a US shopping television network. It was the spin-off channel to the Home Shopping Network (HSN). On April 3, 2007, America's Store ceased broadcasting permanently. America's Store (AS) began in 1988 as the Home Shopping Club Overnight Service, which aired on broadcast stations around the USA from midnight to 9am and, in particular, on WWOR-TV from 3am to 6am in the New York City metro area. In 1989, HSN purchased a number of low-power TV stations and began operating the service 24 hours a day as Home Shopping SPREE. In 1997, the name was changed again to America's Jewelry Store to reflect a switch to exclusively selling jewelry. This incarnation met with limited success, so in 1998, the selection was expanded to include all of HSN's inventory categories, and the word jewelry was removed from the network's name. In 2003, AS was added to the DirecTV lineup. The low-power TV stations owned by HSN with partners and affiliated companies were located in every major metropolitan market - including a transmitter atop the World Trade Center until September 11, 2001. Much of the merchandise presented by AS was distressed inventory from HSN, so the prices were usually dropped until liquidated or removed from air. Competitor QVC had a spin-off channel called \""Q2\"", which lasted only two years from 1994-1996. Following Barry Diller's exit from QVC and purchase of HSN, many former Q2 employees followed him to HSN and America's Store."
9,60,"Graham Dury (born in Clifton, Nottingham) is a British cartoonist. He is known for his work with adult comic Viz, having contributed to the magazine from its early years. He co-conceived and personally created The Fat Slags, one of the magazine's most famous strips. Having previously worked engineering cacti at the University of Leicester, Dury was the first cartoonist to be offered a full-time job at Viz by co-creator Chris Donald in April 1988, when royalties began to make the magazine a profitable business. However, Dury had been contributing to Viz since as early as 1985, often delivering his cartoons by hand to Donald's house. Early creations, Donald noted, tended to have names that rhymed such as Tristam Banks and his Jocular Pranks or Albert Gordon the Traffic Warden. He also noted Dury's fondness of, and impressive ability to draw, cowboy boots. Dury originally worked with Donald in Donald's small office (formerly his bedroom) at his parents' house in Jesmond. As the success of the comic book grew he became a member of the so-called Viz editorial cabinet, theoretically headed by Chris Donald, but which also included - for most of its run - Dury, Simon Donald and Simon Thorp. Dury currently draws such cartoons as Biffa Bacon, Spoilt Bastard, Postman Plod and Roger Mellie. He took over drawing the latter strip from Chris Donald when he gave up day-to-day duties in 1999."
9,47,"Cecily Bonville, 7th Baroness Harington and 2nd Baroness Bonville (c. 30 June 1460 – 12 May 1529) was an English peer, who was also Marchioness of Dorset by her first marriage to Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset, and Countess of Wiltshire by her second marriage to Henry Stafford, 1st Earl of Wiltshire. The Bonvilles were loyal supporters of the House of York during the series of dynastic civil wars that were fought for the English throne, known as the Wars of the Roses (1455–1487). When she was less than a year old, Cecily became the wealthiest heiress in England after her male relatives were slain in battle, fighting against the House of Lancaster. Cecily's life after the death of her first husband in 1501, was marked by an acrimonious dispute with her son and heir, Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset. This was over Cecily's right to remain sole executor of her late husband's estate and to control her own inheritance, both of which Thomas challenged following her second marriage to Henry Stafford; a man many years her junior. Their quarrel required the intervention of King Henry VII and the royal council. Lady Jane Grey, Lady Catherine Grey and Lady Mary Grey were her great-granddaughters. All three were in the Line of Succession to the English throne. Jane, the eldest, reigned as queen for nine days in July 1553."
9,49,"For Italy (Italian: Per l'Italia, PI) was the name of two centrist and mainly Christian-democratic parliamentary groups active in each house of the Italian Parliament: the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. The groups were launched on 12 December 2013, following a split from Civic Choice (SC), whose parliamentary groups included also the Union of the Centre (UdC). The Christian-democratic faction of SC, led by Mario Mauro, Lorenzo Dellai, Andrea Olivero and Lucio Romano, left, along with the UdC, to form the For Italy groups. In July 2014 Mauro's party, the Populars for Italy (PpI), suffered the split of its left-wing, which formed Solidary Democracy (Demo.S), while remaining part of the joint parliamentary groups. In fact, both Dellai and Romano, chairmen of the groups, joined the new party. The groups' composition was quite unstable as they experienced several splits. In October 2014 two deputies, who were once PpI members, left For Italy in order to join the Democratic Party (PD). In November, three deputies belonging to Democratic Centre (CD), joined the group in the Chamber, after having left the Mixed Group; the group was thus renamed \""For Italy–Democratic Centre\"". Also in November the three PpI senators left For Italy in order to join Great Autonomies and Freedom, a centre-right miscellaneous group. In December the three senators of Demo.S, including the group's leader Romano, left in order to join For the Autonomies, a miscellaneous autonomist/centre-left group, while the four remaining senators of For Italy (including the two affiliated to the UdC) and the six deputies of the UdC left in order to join Popular Area, two newly formed groups led by the New Centre-Right. After these movements, the For Italy group in Chamber was left with 13 deputies (8 Demo.S, 3 CD and 2 PpI) and the one in the Senate was effectively disbanded. In August 2015 Carmelo Lo Monte left CD and PI in the Chamber, while the following September Maurizio Baradello joined Demo.S and PI. In January 2015 the group changed its name to Solidary Democracy – Democratic Centre."

8,2,"Phellinus ellipsoideus (formerly Fomitiporia ellipsoidea) is a species of polypore fungus in the family Hymenochaetaceae, a specimen of which produced the largest fungal fruit body ever recorded. Found in China, the fruit bodies produced by the species are brown, woody basidiocarps that grow on dead wood, where the fungus feeds as a saprotroph. The basidiocarps are perennial, allowing them to grow very large under favourable circumstances. They are resupinate, measuring 30 centimetres (12 in) or more in length, though typically extending less than a centimetre from the surface of the wood. P. ellipsoideus produces distinct ellipsoidal spores, after which it is named, and unusual setae. These two features allow it to be readily differentiated microscopically from other, similar species. Chemical compounds isolated from the species include several steroidal compounds. These may have pharmacological applications, but further research is needed. The species was named in 2008 by Bao-Kai Cui and Yu-Cheng Dai based on collections made in Fujian Province. It was placed in the genus Fomitiporia, but later analysis suggests that it is more closely related to Phellinus species. It was revealed in 2011 that a very large fruit body, measuring up to 1,085 cm (427 in) in length, had been found on Hainan Island. The specimen, which was 20 years old, was estimated to weigh between 400 and 500 kilograms (880 and 1,100 lb). This was markedly larger than the previously largest recorded fungal fruit body, a specimen of Rigidoporus ulmarius found in the United Kingdom that had a circumference of 425 cm (167 in). The findings were formally published in September 2011, but attracted international attention from the mainstream press prior to this."

9,7,"KVVZ (Hot 100.7 FM) is a radio station licensed to San Rafael, California, USA and it serves the San Francisco area. The station is currently owned by Univision Radio License Corporation. The station serves as the northern simulcast of its sister station KVVF/Santa Clara. Its studios are in the Financial District of San Francisco, and the KVVZ transmitter is in San Rafael. In 1994, KTID-FM dropped adult contemporary for classical music and ended its simulcast of KTID (AM). Between 1999 and 2004, KVVZ was KJQI, (later KSFB) contemporary Christian 100.7 K-JOY (later \""The Bridge\""). Between 2004 and June 27, 2005, KVVZ began simulcasting with KVVF and became the \""pop, rock y reggaeton\"" station, Viva 100.7. KVVF was also owned by Univision, who later assumed the license of KVVZ in a trade from Salem Communications in 2004. WPPN in Chicago also went to Univision, while stations in Houston, Texas, Dallas, Texas and Chicago went to Salem. The Dallas station has since been resold. On October 13, 2011, the former station branding La Kalle changed to Latino Mix. On March 14, 2014, the station started repeatedly playing Nelly's \""Hot in Herre\"" uninterrupted, most likely an act of stunting. On March 17, 2014, KVVZ and KVVF started broadcasting at 5:05pm, beginning with a \""history lesson\"" about the first \""Hot\"" station that covered the San Jose area from 1987 to 1995, followed by the return of Chuy Gomez, a radio host formerly from KMEL, and aired a Mix Show. Although their playlist favors R&B/Hip-Hop hits, KVVF/KVVZ is programming the station as a Rhythmic Top 40 and targets a bilingual and younger Hispanic audience using the same formula as sister station KBBT/San Antonio. In a statement from Station Content Director Makr Arias, “We just feel like The Bay Area has been asking for something new and fresh. It’s a format they call Top 40/Rhythmic with a little bit of hip-hop, R&B and Top 40 crossed-over.”"
8,2,"Penicillium camemberti is a species of fungus in the family Trichocomaceae. It is used in the production of Camembert, Brie, Langres, Coulommiers and Cambozola cheeses, on which colonies of P. camemberti form a hard, white crust. It is responsible for giving these cheeses their distinctive taste. An allergy to the antibiotic penicillin does not necessarily imply an allergy to cheeses made using P. camemberti. When making soft cheese that involves Penicillium camemberti, the mold may be mixed into the ingredients before being placed in the molds, or it may be added to the outside of the cheese after it is removed from the cheese molds. P. camemberti is responsible for the soft, buttery texture of Brie and Camembert, but a too high concentration may lead to an undesirable bitter taste. Using PCR techniques, cheese manufacturers can control cheese making by monitoring the mycelial growth of P. camemberti. This is particularly significant, as controlling the growth is important to maintain desirable levels of compounds for flavor and to keep toxicity at a safe level."
9,13,"Misty Dawn Marie Hyman (born March 23, 1979) is an American former competition swimmer, Olympic gold medalist, and former world record-holder. Hyman won the gold medal in the women's 200-meter butterfly at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. In March 1996, she just missed making the U.S. Olympic team for the 1996 Games, finishing third and fourth at the U.S. Olympic Trials in the 100- and 200-meter butterfly events. Hyman competed as a member of the U.S. Finswimming Team at the 8th World Championship held in Hungary during August 1996. At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, Hyman was only expected to contend for silver in women's 200-meter butterfly on the night of September 20, 2000, as Australian Susie O'Neill was expected to repeat her title (O'Neill had been undefeated in the 200-meter butterfly for the previous 3–4 years; and was swimming in her home country). Hyman was so shocked that she looked at the scoreboard three times just to make sure that she had won. Hyman's victory was largely credited to her expert use of the very difficult fish kick on turns. Also in 2000, Hyman was ranked 35th in the world in the 50-meter butterfly, twelfth in the 100-meter butterfly, and second in the 200-meter butterfly. Hyman failed to qualify for the 2004 Summer Olympics after finishing a disappointing 8th place in the 100-meter and 200-meter butterfly at the U.S. Olympic Trials. She retired from the sport of swimming shortly after."

Pickering involved a Township High School teacher who was dismissed after writing a letter to a local newspaper which criticised how the Township Board of Education and the district superintendent had handled past proposals to raise new revenue for the schools. The claim that his writing the letter was protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments was rejected by the Board of Education. He appealed the Board's action to the Circuit Court of Will County and then to the Supreme Court of Illinois, which both affirmed his dismissal.

Hoffner was the head football coach at the University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire from 1999 to 2005. He was an assistant football coach at University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point from 1991 to 1998 and served as the offensive coordinator at the University of South Dakota from 2006 to 2007. Hoffner played college football and ran track at Valley City State University, from which he graduated in 1989. He is a native of Esmond, North Dakota. In August 2012 Hoffner was charged by local authorities after a staff member at Minnesota State discovered videos of his naked children on a cell phone that was issued to Hoffner by the university. Hoffner was removed from his position as head football coach and placed on administrative leave. The charges were dismissed in December 2012. The judge who dismissed the charges ruled that the videos of the children amounted to nothing more than them acting silly after a bath. Hoffner was later fired by Minnesota State. In January 2014, he was hired by Minot State University to serve as their head football coach. In April 2014, Hoffner was reinstated in his position at Minnesota State after an arbitrator ruled in his favor. Minnesota State destroyed notes from its controversial investigation of Hoffner, and the Minnesota legislative auditor’s office meanwhile said it was “surprised” that the school’s investigator, an affirmative action officer, “destroyed her contemporaneous interview notes” when she conducted an investigation for Richard Davenport, the college's president. The school's investigator conducted flawed interviews in which questioning was not recorded or conducted under oath. Hoffner received Division II Region 5 Coach of the Year honors in December 2014 from the American Football Coaches Association. Under Hoffner's guidance in 2014, the Minnesota State University Mavericks won their second consecutive NSIC Championship."

7,9,"The Reading Festival Bridge is an occasionally present footbridge over the River Thames at Reading in the English county of Berkshire. When present, the bridge links the site of the Reading Festival, on the south bank of the river, with camp sites and car parking on the north bank. The bridge is within the security perimeter of the festival, and is only available for use by festival goers. The bridge structure is a temporary construction, erected on permanent footings, and was first erected to serve visitors to the Reading Festival in 2008 at an initial cost of £1 million. The intention was that the bridge would be dismantled and stored for most of the year, being re-erected for future festivals. It replaced a ferry service operated in previous years, which caused complaints over excessive queues. The bridge crosses the river from the western end of the main festival site, some 200 m (660 ft) east of Scours Lane and within the Borough of Reading. The northern end of the bridge lies in the Oxfordshire civil parish of Mapledurham, on land leased from the Mapledurham Estate. Like the main festival site, the northern camp site and car park is used as farmland for most of the year. In 2009, a wider bridge with improved aesthetics was constructed. The construction sequence of the 2009 bridge also resulted in less disruption to river traffic. Only a single two-hour river closure order was required when installing the bridge, and similarly when removing it. All construction work was carried out at the bridge site, rather than upstream on the Mapledurham estate."

The album, Songs About Jane, was released in June 2002. The album's lead single \""Harder to Breathe\"" received heavy airplay, which helped propel the album to number 6 on the US Billboard 200. The album's second and third singles, \""This Love\"" and \""She Will Be Loved\"", were worldwide hits in 2004. Five singles were released from the album. For the next few years, the band toured extensively worldwide in support of Songs About Jane and issued two live recordings: 2004's 1.22.03.Acoustic and 2005's Live – Friday the 13th.

7,12,"The Russell Hotel or Hotel Russell is a former hotel located at 102–104 St. Stephen's Green South in Dublin, Ireland. The hotel had a fine dining restaurant that was awarded one Michelin star in 1974. In the first year of the publication of the Michelin Guide to Ireland and the United Kingdom, the Russell Hotel finally received its first star, after many years cooking and serving at high levels. Unfortunately, the final curtain fell on the hotel that same year. The Russell Hotel was founded in the context of the \""Temperance Movement\"". Founder Sir Thomas Russell, 1st Baronet (1841–1920) was a staunch supporter of this movement. Sir Thomas's son-in-law Victor Marcel Charles Barrois de Sarigny conducted the hotel until 1929. According to an advertisement in 1927, it was already a well known restaurant with a full license. Only after the takeover by the Besson family in 1947 was the hotel associated with haute cuisine. After the acquisition of The Russell Hotel by the Besson family, a number of French chefs were hired. The ITGWU (Hotel and Restaurant Branch) did not like this very much, due to the existing high unemployment, but quickly reached an agreement on the training of Irish chefs and kitchen staff. Many Irish chefs received (a part of) their training here. In 1963, at the publication of the Egon Ronay Guide, The Russell Hotel was the only hotel in Ireland awarded three stars. In 1973, the hotel was awarded two stars, despite a decline in the number of stars awarded by about 30%. The Guide awarded the restaurant one star in 1974. Well known chefs at The Russell Hotel were Pierre Rolland, Jackie Needham and Roger Noblet. It was under the leadership of head chef Matt Dowling that it earned its star."

9,13,"Peter Granville Lee, affectionately known as \""Leapy\"", born at Arthingworth, Northamptonshire, on 27 August 1945, is a former cricketer who played for Northamptonshire and Lancashire. He was a right-arm fast-medium bowler who moved the ball off the seam and became among the most effective bowlers in English county cricket during the 1970s. Presumably because his batting was impotent as shown by his highest first-class score in more than 200 matches being 26, Lee appears never to have been considered seriously for Test cricket. He toured South Africa twice with teams organised by Derrick Robins. Lee played for five seasons from 1967 for Northamptonshire without ever becoming a regular in the side. He moved to Lancashire in 1972 largely as insurance for the likelihood that regular opening bowlers Peter Lever and Ken Shuttleworth would be called up for Test cricket by England, but with those bowlers doing extremely badly, Lee became their first choice opening bowler. 1973 saw Lee massively surpass his first season’s promise and become the mainstay of Lancashire’s bowling, actually taking more wickets in the County Championship than any other bowler. In 1974 Lee was consistently handicapped by injuries and illness: he played about half his county’s matches but was at no point fully fit Nevertheless, he returned for a full season and even greater success in 1975. His 112 first-class wickets was the highest by any bowler that season: indeed the highest by any England-qualified bowler during the 1970s. He was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in the 1976 edition of the almanack. Having reached the top of the tree as a bowler, Peter Lee remained one of the most persistent and hard-working county bowlers during 1976 and 1977, though he took only two-thirds as many wickets as he did in 1975. However, 1978 saw Lee play only one match due to a serious shoulder injury which led to a delayed operation after weeks of examination. Lee made a \""gallant\"" return to fitness in 1979 but completely lost form, finishing with 22 wickets for 40 runs apiece that season. Indeed, apart from a career-best eight for 34 against Oxford University in 1980, Lee never again did much worthy of his former reputation, and at the end of 1982 he was released by Lancashire. After that, he played for Durham in the Minor Counties Championship during the 1983 season, but took only sixteen wickets for 29.56 apiece and was released. During the 20/20 Finals Day in August 2011, Paul Allott suggested Lee’s decline coincided with the total loss of his run up, similar to the yips suffered mainly by left arm spinners."

8,57,"Cope's gray tree frog (Hyla chrysoscelis, also called the southern gray tree frog) is a species of tree frog found in the United States. It is almost indistinguishable from the gray tree frog, Hyla versicolor, and shares much of its geographic range. Both species are variable in color, mottled gray to gray-green, resembling the bark of trees. These are tree frogs of woodland habitats, though they will sometimes travel into more open areas to reach a breeding pond. The only readily noticeable difference between the two species is the call — Cope's has a faster-paced and slightly higher-pitched call than H. versicolor. In addition, H. chrysoscelis is reported to be slightly smaller, more arboreal, and more tolerant of dry conditions than H. versicolor."

Invariably playing with thick, round spectacles, the 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m), 245 pounds (111 kg) Mikan is seen as one of the pioneers of professional basketball, redefining it as a game of so-called big men with his prolific rebounding, shot blocking, and his talent to shoot over smaller defenders with his ambidextrous hook shot, the result of his namesake Mikan Drill. Mikan had a successful playing career, winning seven NBL, BAA, and NBA championships, an All-Star MVP trophy, and three scoring titles. He was a member of the first four NBA All-Star games, and the first six All-BAA and All-NBA Teams. Mikan was so dominant that he caused several rule changes in the NBA, among them, the introduction of the goaltending rule, the widening of the foul lane—known as the \""Mikan Rule\""—and the creation of the shot clock. After his playing career, Mikan became one of the founders of the American Basketball Association (ABA), serving as commissioner of the league. He was also vital for the forming of the Minnesota Timberwolves. In his later years, Mikan was involved in a long-standing legal battle against the NBA, fighting to increase the meager pensions for players who had retired before the league became lucrative. In 2005, Mikan died after a long battle with diabetes. For his feats, Mikan was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1959, made the 25th and 35th NBA Anniversary Teams of 1970 and 1980, and was elected one of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players ever in 1996. Since April 2001, a statue of Mikan shooting his trademark hook shot graces the entrance of the Timberwolves' Target Center."

7,39,"6500 Kodaira, provisional designation 1993 ET, is a dark, rare-type, and eccentric asteroid and Mars-crosser, approximately 17 kilometres (11 mi) in diameter. It was discovered on 15 March 1993, by Japanese amateur astronomers Kin Endate and Kazuro Watanabe at Kitami Observatory in eastern Hokkaidō, Japan. The carbonaceous and uncommon B-type asteroid, of which only a few dozen bodies are currently known, orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.6–3.9 AU once every 4 years and 7 months (16,808 days). It shows a very high eccentricity of 0.42, as its orbit spans from within the orbit of Mars to the outer region of the asteroid belt. Its orbital plane is notably inclined by 29° with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. The first precovery was obtained at the Chilean Cerro El Roble Station in 1970, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 23 years prior to its discovery. A rotational light-curve, obtained from photometric observations by American astronomer Robert Stevens at the Center for Solar System Studies in October 2014, gave a well-define rotation period of 5.400±0.001 hours with a brightness variation of 0.78 in magnitude (U=3). Previous observations at Montgomery College Observatory (MCO), the Preston Gott and McDonald Observatories, and at the Palomar Transient Factory gave similar periods between 5.398 and 5.496 hours (U=3-/3-/2). The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a low albedo of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 16.8 kilometers (10.4 mi). The minor planet was named after Japanese astronomer and director of NAOJ, Keiichi Kodaira (b. 1937), whose interests lie in astrophysics and galactic physics. In the 1980s, he was head of IAU's commission of Theory of Stellar Atmospheres (comm. 36).

Its whimsical and unique vision is a clear indication of how Soft Machine might have progressed under Ayers' tenure. He is accompanied on the LP by his Soft Machine colleagues Robert Wyatt, Mike Ratledge and Hugh Hopper. After a Soft Machine tour of the USA with the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Ayers had decided to retire from the music business. Hendrix however, presented Ayers with an acoustic Gibson J-200 guitar on the promise that he continue his songwriting. Ayers repaired to a small London flat where he composed and arranged a whole LP which was then presented to Malcolm Jones' fledgling Harvest label where it was recorded by Peter Jenner for the then exorbitant sum of £4000. Joy features many of Ayers' most enduring songs from \""The Lady Rachel\"" to \""Girl on a Swing\"", the latter still, regularly covered by artists to this day like Candie Payne and The Ladybug Transistor. It was on Joy that Ayers developed his sonorous vocal delivery, an avant-garde song construction and an affection for bizarre instrumentation that would have a deep influence far into the 1970s and indeed the present day. For the recording of Syd Barrett's first solo album—The Madcap Laughs—Soft Machine was brought in to do overdubs for a few of Barrett's tracks. It was during this time, Barrett did guitar for Ayers on his track \""Religious Experience\"", (later titled \""Singing a Song in the Morning\"") this version wasn't released until the 2003 reissue of Joy."

The lake is estimated to be 423 feet (129 m) deep and encompasses 1,191 acres (482 ha). Jenny Lake is considered to be a major focal point in Grand Teton National Park, with many hiking trails, scenic boat rides, and quick access to the major climbing routes onto the tallest peaks of the Teton Range.

Jenny Lake is a starting point for many day and overnight hiking trips. The 7.1-mile (11.4 km) Jenny Lake Trail loops around the lake and is considered to be relatively easy due to the small altitude gain of 700 feet (210 m). However, the altitude increases rapidly once Cascade Canyon is entered. Jenny Lake is named after a Shoshone Indian woman who married an Englishman, Richard \""Beaver Dick\"" Leigh.

7,39,"DDO 190 (or UGC 9240) is a dwarf irregular galaxy in the vicinity of the Milky Way, as it is relatively small and lacks clear structure. It is 9.10 million light-years (2.79 Mpc) away from us and lies out of the Local Group, determined by the tip of the red giant branch method. The outskirts of the galaxy are harbouring older (reddish) stars, while the centre is crowded with younger (bluish) stars. Heated gas is observed at several places. DDO 190 still experiences some active star formation. The galaxy is categorised as a Magellanic dwarf galaxy of morphological type Im. Its metallicity is [Fe/H] = −1.55 ± 0.12. DDO 190 is small, but not tiny: about 15,000 light years across—about 1/6 the size of our galaxy. It is also well outside the Local Group, which contains nearby galaxies (the Andromeda galaxy is less than 3 million light years distant from Earth, for comparison), and is instead thought to be part of the M94 galaxy group. But if true it is fairly isolated even from the others on its team; the nearest neighbor appears to be another dwarf galaxy, DDO 187, at a distance of 3 million light-years (0.92 Mpc)."

8,57,"Shearwaters are medium-sized long-winged seabirds. There are more than 30 species of shearwaters, a few larger ones in the genus Calonectris and many smaller species in the genus Puffinus. The Procellaria petrels and Bulweria were believed to belong to this group, but are only distantly related based on more recent studies, while the Pseudobulweria and Lugensa \""petrels\"" are more closely related. The genus Puffinus can be divided into a group of small species close to Calonectris and a few larger ones more distantly related to both. These birds are most common in temperate and cold waters. They are pelagic outside the breeding season. These tubenose birds fly with stiff wings and use a \""shearing\"" flight technique (flying very close to the water and seemingly cutting or \""shearing\"" the tips of waves) to move across wave fronts with the minimum of active flight. This technique gives the group its English name. Some small species, like the Manx shearwater are cruciform in flight, with their long wings held directly out from their bodies. Many are long-distance migrants, perhaps most spectacularly sooty shearwaters, which cover distances in excess of 14,000 km (8,700 mi) from their breeding colony on the Falkland Islands (52°S 60°W) to as far as 70° north latitude in the North Atlantic Ocean off northern Norway. One study found Sooty shearwaters migrating nearly 40,000 miles (64,000 kilometers) a year, which would give them the longest animal migration ever recorded electronically. Short-tailed shearwaters perform an even longer \""figure of eight\"" loop migration in the Pacific Ocean from Tasmania to as far north as the Arctic Ocean off northwest Alaska. They are long-lived. A Manx shearwater breeding on Copeland Island, Northern Ireland, is currently (2003/2004) the oldest known wild bird in the world: ringed as an adult (at least 5 years old) in July 1953, it was retrapped in July 2003, at least 55 years old. Manx shearwaters migrate over 10,000 km (6,200 mi) to South America in winter, using waters off southern Brazil and Argentina, so this bird has covered a minimum of 1,000,000 km (620,000 mi) on migration alone. Shearwaters come to islands and coastal cliffs only to breed. They are nocturnal at the colonial breeding sites, preferring moonless nights to minimize predation. They nest in burrows and often give eerie contact calls on their night-time visits. They lay a single white egg. They feed on fish, squid, and similar oceanic food. Some will follow fishing boats to take scraps, commonly the sooty shearwater; these species also commonly follow whales to feed on fish disturbed by them. Their primary technique for feeding is diving and some species diving as much as 70 m (230 ft) under water. Shearwaters are part of the family Procellariidae, which also includes fulmarine petrels, prions, and gadfly petrels."

9,60,"Arny Freytag (born April 12, 1950) is an American photographer who specializes in glamour photography. He began working for Playboy magazine in 1976 and at one time was one of only two photographers who produced the Playboy centerfold photographs. Freytag grew up in Chicago, Illinois, attending Sutherland grammar school and Luther South High School. He graduated from the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts in 1970, and from Brooks Institute of Photography (Santa Barbara, California) in 1974. After an initial period as an apprentice at Playboy, he joined Mario Casilli, Richard Fegley and Ken Marcus as the principal photographers at Playboy’s California studio. During his studies at Brooks, Freytag became proficient with the 4”x5” view camera, a skill that served him well shooting the monthly multi-page (gatefold) Playboy centerfold. Attempting to produce the very highest quality possible for the centerfold image, Playboy used the very large 8\""x10” view camera. Due to the amount of strobe (electronic flash) light needed to expose that large a sheet of film, Freytag, at first of necessity and later by choice, specialized in the use of elaborate lighting setups, often using dozens of flash heads. Later, after Playboy abandoned film and moved to digital cameras, Freytag continued to create images using up to fifty flash heads, each light meticulously placed and targeted to illuminate a small area of the photo. Freytag likens his technique to that of a painter, using each light as his brush strokes, selectively illuminating each area as he incrementally builds the final image. Freytag no longer works for Playboy. His last centerfold shoot was of Playmate Amanda Streich, Miss December of 2012. He currently lives in Woodland Hills, California."

4,18,"New Politics is an independent socialist journal founded in 1961 and still published in the United States today. While it is inclusive of articles from a variety of left-of-center positions, the publication leans strongly toward a Third camp, democratic Marxist perspective, placing it typically to the left of the liberal or social democratic views in the journal Dissent. Julius and Phyllis Jacobson were the founders and longtime co-editors of the journal, which had a political center of gravity reflective of their youthful formative experience in the Independent Socialist League of the 1940s and 1950s. During the Cold War, New Politics espoused the idea that socialism is indissoluble from democracy and freedom and argued strongly against totalitarian communist states and models of socialism as corruptions of and departures from the socialist ideal. The journal is perhaps best known for having published the seminal article by Hal Draper, \""The Two Souls of Socialism,\"" in 1966. It was also the first English-language publication to publish articles by the dissident Polish socialists Jacek Kuroń and Karol Modzelewski. The first series of New Politics ran from 1961 through 1976, after which it ceased publication for a decade. The journal was restarted in 1986 and has been in print ever since, publishing two issues per year.

In so doing, the Court extended the holding of New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982), which had upheld laws banning the distribution of child pornography against a similar First Amendment challenge, and distinguished Stanley v.

4,45,"Tales from the Brothers Gibb: A History in Song is a box set compilation released by The Bee Gees in 1990. Originally released on four cassettes and four compact discs, Tales is a summary of the Bee Gees output from their third album, 1967's Bee Gees 1st to the group's most recent album (at the time), 1989's One. Considering the peculiar nature of the Gibbs' catalogue, the compilers neatly arranged each disc/cassette to represent the Bee Gees at different periods of their career called Chapters. Chapter I consists of songs from their folky/psychedelic era of 1967–1970; Chapter II covers the ballad heavy period of 1971–1974; Chapter III tracks the disco era from 1975–1979 and Chapter IV consists of the Gibbs' output in the 80's, including material from their two Warner Bros. albums. Many B-sides made their CD debut on Tales as well as solo material, unreleased tracks and live performances not available anywhere else. Album cuts, with a few exceptions, were not included here as to keep the focus on single releases. Several tracks received new stereo mixes prepared by Bill Inglot especially for this set. \""World\"", \""I've Gotta Get a Message to You\"" and \""Words\"" are notable for the improved stereo mixes found on Tales. \""Tomorrow Tomorrow\"" received its first stereo mix (the Best of Bee Gees 1986 CD featured the song in mono while the original 1969 Best of Bee Gees LP did not include the track), while many of the B-sides such as \""Sinking Ships\"", \""Barker of the UFO\"" and \""The Singer Sang His Song\"" were mixed in stereo for the first time.

3,4,"Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, (/ˈbɑːkiː/) 438 U.S. 265 (1978) was a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. It upheld affirmative action, allowing race to be one of several factors in college admission policy. However, the court ruled that specific racial quotas, such as the 16 out of 100 seats set aside for minority students by the University of California, Davis School of Medicine, were impermissible. Although the Supreme Court had outlawed segregation in schools, and had even ordered school districts to take steps to assure integration, the question of the legality of voluntary affirmative action programs initiated by universities was unresolved. Proponents deemed such programs necessary to make up for past discrimination, while opponents believed they were illegal and a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. An earlier case that the Supreme Court had taken in an attempt to address the issue, DeFunis v. Odegaard (1974), was dismissed on procedural grounds. Allan P. Bakke, an engineer and former United States Marine Corps officer, sought admission to medical school, but was rejected for admission by several, in part because, in his early thirties, he was considered too old. After twice being rejected by the University of California, Davis, he brought suit in state court. The California Supreme Court struck down the program as violative of the rights of white applicants and ordered Bakke admitted. The U.S. Supreme Court accepted the case amid wide public attention. The case fractured the court; the nine justices issued a total of six opinions. The judgment of the court was written by Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.; two different blocs of four justices joined various parts of Powell's opinion. Finding diversity in the classroom to be a compelling state interest, Powell opined that affirmative action in general was allowed under the Constitution and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Nevertheless, UC Davis's program went too far for a majority of justices, and it was struck down and Bakke admitted. The practical effect of Bakke was that most affirmative action programs continued without change. Questions about whether the Bakke case was merely a plurality opinion or binding precedent were answered in 2003 when the court upheld Powell's position in a majority opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger."

7,12,"Towson United Methodist Church is a large United Methodist Church in the historic Baltimore County, Maryland suburb of Towson. Its past, rooted in 19th century America, and subsequent growth in the two centuries since then, have closely paralleled the nation's political and sociological trends. It was a congregation split asunder in 1861 on the eve of the American Civil War in a border state of divided loyalties, which eventually reunited and built a church in the post-World War II era of the 1950s, a time of reconciliation and rapid growth by mainline Protestant denominations, especially in the more affluent suburbs. The 1,000-member church, currently pastored by Rev. Roderick Miller, has a number of community outreach programs, including an accredited child care center and a Boy Scout troop, and actively supports a home for unwed mothers, overseas missions, and Habitat for Humanity projects.

9,6,"Adam of Eynsham, O.S.B., (died after 1233) was a medieval English chronicler and writer. He was a monk and Abbot of Eynsham Abbey. Adam was born around 1155 in Oxford to a middle-class family. His father, a doctor in Oxford, was named Edmund. Edmund's other children included William and Edmund. Adam entered Eynsham Abbey, and was later appointed as prior before 1197. In that year a dispute arose between Hugh of Lincoln, the Bishop of Lincoln, who held the right of patronage over Eynsham, and King Richard I of England, over rights to the abbey. Adam appears as the presumed compiler of the Eynsham cartulary drawn up at that point for the bishop's use in this argument. Hugh then named Adam his chaplain, and he became Hugh's constant companion until the bishop's death in 1200. This experience led Adam to write Magna Vita Sancti Hugonis or The Life of St Hugh of Lincoln. This work became Adam's claim to fame, and is one of the more trustworthy and fullest of the hagiographies existing from the Middle Ages. Adam went to France while England was under an interdict during the later part of King John's reign, but when the interdict was lifted, Hugh's successor at Lincoln, Hugh of Wells, named Adam the Abbot of Eynsham in 1213. Adam was deposed by Hugh of Wells for being a \""manifest dilapidator\"" of the monastery's property, on 1 June 1228 but is still referred to as abbot on 10 June. Eynsham had fallen into debt, and even though it had repaid the debts, the bishop still deposed Adam. After his deposition from office, Adam retired to Little Rollright, and in 1233 he was allowed an exemption from having to do suit for the manor he was residing on. Presumably, he died soon after this occurrence. The Vita of Hugh was written at the request of two monks of Winchester, and was completed about 1212. It effectively supplanted all earlier works about Hugh, and although reliable for events during Hugh's adult life, has some errors in the sections dealing with Hugh's early life. The monastic historian David Knowles, O.S.B., calls the work a \""clear and living picture of the great bishop\"". Another work by Adam was a description of a vision that his brother Edmund saw in 1196, titled The Vision of the Monk of Eynsham, which survives in a few manuscripts."

8,52,"Zinfandel (also known as Primitivo) is a variety of black-skinned wine grape. The variety is grown in over 10 percent of California vineyards. DNA analysis has revealed that it is genetically equivalent to the Croatian grapes Crljenak Kaštelanski and Tribidrag, as well as to the Primitivo variety traditionally grown in Apulia (the \""heel\"" of Italy), where it was introduced in the 18th century. The grape found its way to the United States in the mid-19th century, where it became known by variations of the name \""Zinfandel\"", a name which is probably of Austrian origin. The grapes typically produce a robust red wine, although in the United States a semi-sweet rosé (blush-style) wine called White Zinfandel has six times as many sales as the red wine. The grape's high sugar content can be fermented into levels of alcohol exceeding 15 percent. The taste of the red wine depends on the ripeness of the grapes from which it is made. Red berry fruit flavors like raspberry predominate in wines from cooler areas, whereas blackberry, anise and pepper notes are more common in wines made in warmer areas and in wines made from the earlier-ripening Primitivo clone."

The date of foundation of the church, which is in the village of Llanfair-yng-Nghornwy, is unknown, but the oldest parts date from the 11th or 12th century. It has twice been enlarged: in the 15th century, when the chancel was rebuilt, and in the 16th century, when a chapel was added to the south of the chancel, separated by three arches. The tower at the west end is from the 17th century. A south porch of unknown date has been converted into a vestry, and the church is now entered through the tower. St Mary's is a Grade I listed building, a national designation given to buildings of \""exceptional, usually national, interest\"", in particular because it is regarded as \""a fine rural parish church, incorporating significant early Medieval fabric\"". Writers in the 19th century commented on the \""lofty square tower\"", the \""very good\"" east window, and the \""many elegant monuments\""; the clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones called St Mary's \""one of the best specimens of an old parish church in the island\"". In the 21st century, one writer has noted the \""impressive lychgate\"" and a guide to the buildings of the region calls it \""the most important church in north west Anglesey\"". The church is still used for worship by the Church in Wales, one of nine in a combined parish, although as of 2013 there has not been an incumbent priest since September 2009.

9,13,"Ian Dunstan (born 28 February 1955) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with Footscray in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Originally recruited from Fish Creek in South Gippsland, he is the son Maurie Dunstan and brother of Graeme Dunstan, both former Collingwood players. He was a tallish ruck-rover with great ability to win the ball and great skill at kicking straight in the direction of goal. His early years with Footscray were nonetheless patchy, and he lost his place in the senior side after a slump in 1974 and again in 1976 – though he returned to play well in the last round draw with Carlton and in his only final against Geelong a week later. Paradoxically, it was whilst Footscray were declining from the middle bracket to perennial contenders for the wooden spoon with St Kilda and Melbourne that Dunstan rose to the heights not only of Footscray's top running players, but even to representing Victoria. On 1 July 1978 Dunstan and Kelvin Templeton kicked against St Kilda a record VFL/AFL total for two players in one team of 22 goals 12 behinds (144 points), narrowly beating the total of Doug Strang and Jack Titus for Richmond against North Melbourne on 9 May 1931. Of this Dunstan kicked seven goals, three behinds but had over thirty kicks overall, many of which led to Templeton's record total of twenty-four scoring shots, which contributed to Footscray breaking Carlton's 1969 record VFL score. During the last quarter it was said that Dunstan, who never otherwise kicked five in a match, aimed to reach double figures. As a result of this and other performances, Dunstan represented Victoria several times in the last three years of the late 1970s. As Footscray struggled further owing to the club's limited financial resources – going from seven wins in 1978 and 1979 to only five in 1980, two in 1981 and three in 1982 – Dunstan won three best and fairest awards in 1979, 1981 and 1982 but Footscray's finances and a youth policy caused them to allow Dunstan to cross to North Melbourne for the 1983 season. He did not play a senior match in 1983 owing to injury and his debut for North Melbourne proved to be embarrassing, with the Kangaroos going down by 137 points to Carlton. He played the first three games in the seniors but it was clear his best days were beyond him and afterward he played only three more senior matches. At the end of 1984 Ian Dunstan retired from the VFL and played briefly with Werribee in the Victorian Football Association. He later joined struggling Association club Sunshine where he had the unfortunate fate to be coach of the senior club when it was expelled from the competition mid-season in 1989."
9,46,"George Bell & Sons was a book publishing house located in London, United Kingdom, from 1839 to 1986. It was founded by George Bell as an educational bookseller, with the intention of selling the output of London university presses; but became best known as an independent publisher of classics and children's books. One of Bell's first investments in publishing was a series of Railway Companions; that is, booklets of timetables and tourist guides. Within a year Bell's publishing business had outstripped his retail business, and he elected to move from his original offices into Fleet Street. There G. Bell & Sons branched into the publication of books on art, architecture, and archaeology, in addition to the classics for which the company was already known. Bell's reputation was only improved by his association with Henry Cole. In the mid-1850s, Bell expanded again, printing the children's books of Margaret Gatty (Parables from Nature) and Juliana Horatia Ewing (the Nursery Magazine). Around the same time, in 1854, he acquired J. & J.J. Deighton, a bookseller's outfit in Cambridge, which thereupon changed its name to Deighton, Bell & Co. and continued to operate out of Cambridge until at least 1998, although it had been sold to Dawson Books by then. Then, in 1856, Bell brought on board as a partner Frederick Daldy, and renamed the company Bell & Daldy. With Daldy, Bell began to print more poetry collections, including the Aldine Edition of British Poets and the works of Andrew Lang and Robert Bridges. To the firm's educational output was added Webster's Dictionary, after Bell acquired the British rights to Webster's work. Then, Bell & Daldy took over the libraries of Henry George Bohn, a Covent Garden publisher, and moved their operation to Bohn's former location. With such an extensive library available for publication, Bell's original retail location in Fleet Street was no longer necessary; the firm moved out of Fleet Street for good in 1867. Daldy left the firm (renamed George Bell & Sons) in 1873, to join the firm of Virtue, Spalding, & Daldy. In 1888, Bell left the piloting of the firm to his sons, Edward and Ernest, but maintained a healthy interest in its day-to-day operation until his death in 1890. In 1910 the firm became a limited liability company, George Bell & Sons, Ltd. In 1926 Edward Bell died; his son Arthur took his place on the board and became chairman himself in 1936. Other members of the board gradually took over the operation of the firm, until Arthur's death in 1968. In 1977, R.P. Hyman became the managing director of Bell & Hyman, Ltd., and the firm moved to Queen Elizabeth Street, London, where it remained until going out of business in 1989. George Bell's brother John also worked for the Bell firm; John managed the Chiswick Press until his death in 1885."

The next two albums, Quand l'éternité... and Mon Pays c'est la terre, were respectively released in September 2006 and November 2008.

7,39,"56 Melete (/ˈmɛlᵻtiː/ MEL-i-tee) is a large and dark main belt asteroid. It is a rather unusual P-type asteroid, probably composed of organic rich silicates, carbon and anhydrous silicates, with possible internal water ice. Melete was discovered by Hermann Goldschmidt from his balcony in Paris, on September 9, 1857. It orbit was computed by E. Schubert, who named it after Melete, the Muse of meditation in Greek mythology. It was originally confused for 41 Daphne before it was confirmed not to be by its second sighting on August 27, 1871. In 1861, the brightness of 56 Melete was shown to vary by German astronomer Friedrich Tietjen. To date, two stellar occultations by Melete have been observed successfully (in 1997 and again in 2002). Melete has been studied by radar. Photometric observations of this asteroid at the Palmer Divide Observatory in Colorado Springs, Colorado in 2007 gave a light curve with a period of 18.151 ± 0.002 hours and a brightness variation of 0.15 ± 0.02 in magnitude.

7,12,"The Château de Charry is a castle, originally 15th century, in the commune of Montcuq in the Lot département of France. The castle was built in three stages. It was initially a keep whose principal masonry was flanked by two polygonal towers. It was encircled by a fortified curtain wall; the remains of this are the third tower, though not connected to the main building, and a rectangular barbican. Cannon positions defended access to the well. An underground passage linked the barbican to one of the towers of the keep. In the 17th century, a second period of building added the central building to the right of the tower and buildings forming the court. In the 19th century, the main building was joined to the round tower of the ramparts. This keep provided a firing line between Montcuq and the keep at Marcilhac, and guaranteed the defence of the Charry valley. The castle is privately owned. It has been listed since 1976 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.

9,47,"Jesus son of Damneus (Greek: Ἰησοῦς του Δαμναίου, Hebrew: ישוע בן דמנאי, Yeshua` ben Damnai) was a Herodian-era High Priest of Israel in Jerusalem, Iudaea Province. In the Antiquities of the Jews (Book 20, Chapter 9) first-century historian Josephus states that Jesus ben Damneus was made high priest after the previous high priest, Ananus son of Ananus, was removed from his position for executing James the brother of Jesus (James the Just). Jesus ben Damneus himself was deposed less than a year later. While the authenticity of some passages in Book 18 of Antiquities of the Jews has been subject to debate, the overwhelming majority of scholars consider the discussion of the death of James in Section 9 of Book 20 to be authentic. The works of Josephus refer to at least twenty different people with the name Jesus, and in chapter 9 of Book 20, Jesus the son of Damneus is thought by many to be distinct from the reference to \""Jesus called Christ\"", who is mentioned along with the identification of James. John Painter states that phrase \""who was called Christ\"" is used by Josephus in this passage \""by way of distinguishing him from others of the same name such as the high priest Jesus son of Damneus, or Jesus son of Gamaliel\"" both having been mentioned by Josephus in this context."
1,48,"The 2012 United States House of Representatives elections were held on Tuesday, November 6, 2012. It coincided with the re-election of President Barack Obama. Elections were held for all 435 seats representing the 50 U.S. states and also for the delegates from the District of Columbia and five major U.S. territories. The winners of this election cycle served in the 113th United States Congress. This was the first congressional election using districts drawn-up based on the 2010 United States Census. Although Democratic candidates received a nationwide plurality of more than 1.4 million votes (1.2%) in all House elections, the Republican Party won a 33-seat advantage in the state-apportioned totals, thus retaining its House majority by 17 seats. This disparity – common in close elections involving single-member district voting – has on occasion been attributed to gerrymandering in the congressional redistricting process following the 2010 United States Census. However, some analysts have argued that Republicans would have won the House even without taking into account the impact of gerrymandering. An alternative explanation was that the large number of Democratic votes in urban centers led to \""unintentional gerrymandering,\"" as compact districts naturally led to \""wasted votes\"" in districts that easily elected Democratic candidates. The GOP also had a greater number of incumbents, who tend to have an advantage in elections. In the previous century, on four occasions the party with a plurality of the popular vote was unable to receive a majority in the House, but only twice since World War II. The last times were in 1952 and 1996, in which the GOP held a majority in the House. The 1942 election was the last time that the Democrats held a majority in the House without winning the popular vote."

7,39,"1500 Jyväskylä, provisional designation 1938 UH, is a stony asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, roughly about 10 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Finnish astronomer Yrjö Väisälä at the Turku Observatory in southwestern Finland, on 16 October 1938. The S-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.8–2.7 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,227 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.19 and is tilted by 7 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. Little is known about the asteroids size, composition, albedo and rotation, despite having a well-observed orbit with the lowest possible uncertainty – which is denoted by a condition code of 0 – and an observation arc that spans over a time period of almost 70 years. With an absolute magnitude of 13.06, the asteroid's diameter could be anywhere between 6 and 14 kilometers for an assumed albedo in the range of 0.05–0.25 (see NASA's conversion table). Since the asteroid's spectral type is that of a brighter stony rather than a darker carbonaceous body, its diameter is on the lower end of NASA's generic conversion table, as an object's diameter decreases, when its albedo increases for a given absolute magnitude. The minor planet was named for the Finnish town Jyväskylä. It is the largest city in the region of Central Finland and on the Finnish Lakeland."

According to the Nigel Williams autobiography \""Had ik maar een vak geleerd\"" (\""If Only I'd Learned a Proper Trade\""), Alex was already an established comedian in Belgium since at least the 1999-2000 season.

He is influenced by action movies, superheroes, comic books and a great variety of music, ranging from Tom Jones and musicals to heavy metal and the new-age music his sister played. His \""rock 'n' roll comedy\"" (as he himself calls it) is mostly a mix of blue comedy and the production of sound effects, similar to Dutch-Moroccan comedian Najib Amhali. Besides his comedy activities, he is also the lead vocalist of hard rock band Diablo Blvd. His first solo comedy show, \""KA-BOOM!\"", spanned the whole 2005-2006 season.

9,49,"The Virginia Central Railroad was an early railroad in the U.S. state of Virginia that operated between 1850 and 1868 from Richmond westward for 206 miles (332 km) to Covington. Chartered in 1836 as the Louisa Railroad by the Virginia General Assembly, the railroad began near the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad's line and expanded westward to Orange County, reaching Gordonsville by 1840. In 1849, the Blue Ridge Railroad was chartered to construct a line over the Blue Ridge Mountains for the Louisa Railroad which reached the base of the Blue Ridge in 1852. After a decision from the U.S. Supreme Court, the Louisa Railroad was allowed to expand eastward from a point near Doswell to Richmond. Renamed as the Virginia Central Railroad in 1850, the railroad bypassed the under construction Blue Ridge Railroad via a temporary track built over Rockfish Gap. This connected the railroad's eastern division with its expanding line across the Blue Ridge in the Shenandoah Valley. Having reached Clifton Forge by 1857, the railroad began operating the completed Blue Ridge Railroad in 1858 and continued preparing for further expansion until the beginning of the American Civil War in 1861. As a prime target for Federal raids by Union Cavalry, the railroad faced significant action against it during the war. Although the war left the railroad with only a fraction of its line left operable, the railroad was running over its entire pre-war length by July 1865. After the war, both longtime president Edmund Fontaine and former Confederate General Williams Carter Wickham served as president of the Virginia Central and oversaw its expansion towards Covington. The Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad was formed in 1868 from the merger of the Virginia Central Railroad and the Covington and Ohio Railroad, and had expanded westward to the Ohio River by 1873 after new financing from Collis P. Huntington was recruited. The new railroad (reorganized as the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway in 1878) expanded eastward in the 1880s via the Peninsula Subdivision to Newport News. The Chesapeake and Ohio operated for over one hundred years until it was reorganized through merger as CSX Transportation in the 1980s. Today, CSX, Amtrak, and the Buckingham Branch Railroad still use portions of the old Virginia Central line for freight and passenger rail service."

4,18,"Ha-Yom (Hebrew: היום‎‎, \""The Day\"") was a Hebrew-language newspaper published from 1886 to mid-1888 from Saint Petersburg, Russia. It was founded and edited by Jehuda Löb Kantor. Ha-Yom was the first daily Hebrew newspaper. When it was launched Ha-Yom had a daily circulation of around 2,400. By 1887 the number of subscribers had fallen to around 1,600. Ha-Yom was characterized by a modern, Europeanized form of journalism, previously unknown in the Hebrew-language press. It was the first Hebrew-language newspaper to rely on telegraphic news agency material for its coverage. Moreover, Kantor contracted correspondents in Jewish centres in Western Europe and the United States. Prominent contributors to Ha-Yom included D. Frischman, A. Rosenfeld and L. Katzenelson. The launching and initial success of Ha-Yom provoked the existing Hebrew-language publications Ha-Meliz and Ha-Tsefirah to convert themselves into daily newspapers. Competition with Aleksander Zederbaum's Ha-Meliz became fierce. Prior to the founding of Ha-Yom, Ha-Meliz had monopolized the Jewish press in the Russia. The fact that Ha-Yom subscribed to the \""Northern Company\"" telegraphic news agency forced Ha-Meliz to do the same. The subscription costs (3,000 rubles per year) became a heavy economic burden for both publications. At an early stage Ha-Yom became the newspaper of choice of many followers of the Lovers of Zion movement. However, Ha-Meliz was able to convince a large portion of them to shift their subscriptions back to Ha-Meliz, thus significantly undercutting the popularity of Ha-Yom. In 1887 the literary Ben-Ami (\""Son of my people\"") was introduced as a monthly supplement to Ha-Yom. Four issues of Ben-Ami were published. The last few editions of Ha-Yom were edited by J. L. Gordon. After Ha-Yom was closed down, Kantor became the editor of Ha-Meliz in 1889."

9,49,"Livable Rotterdam (Dutch: Leefbaar Rotterdam) is a local political party in the municipality of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, which was founded by Ronald Sørensen in 2001. It won the council elections of March 2002 due to the charismatic leadership of Pim Fortuyn. This made it the city's largest political party, a position which for the previous thirty years had been held by the Labour Party. Livable Rotterdam started as a spin-off of the national party Livable Netherlands but is commonly seen as the local party of the LPF (Pim Fortuyn List), the national party of Pim Fortuyn which was founded just after Pim Fortuyn was fired as lijsttrekker of the Livable Netherlands party in spring 2002. The party consists of numerous members that are new to politics and were attracted to Fortuyn's dreams of political change. The party attracts attention and criticism for the upfront behavior of its members and its unconventional, if sometimes right-leaning vision, especially on issues of immigration and inter-culture tolerance. This has resulted in numerous splits in the faction since 2002. Nieuw Rechts was an example of this. In the municipal elections of March 7, 2006 Livable Rotterdam lost 5%, dropping to 29,7% of their votes and PvdA gained 15%, making the latter the biggest party again, with 37,4% of the votes. Before the elections, Livable Rotterdam declared it would not enter in a coalition with PvdA and several members even declared that, irrespective of the coalition, they would leave the council if PvdA would become the biggest party (which has happened). After the municipal elections of March 3, 2010 the Public Prosecutor in Rotterdam launched an investigation into how proxy votes were solicited by the party, after an e-mail emerged in which one of the party’s councillors gives tips on how to accumulate these. Ronald Buijt wrote that he had 50 reliable citizens of the city who could take the proxy votes to the polling stations. The electoral council said this went against the spirit of proxy voting, which should only be used at the initiative of the voter. This irregularity was added to a litany of complaints against the poll in Rotterdam in these elections (many of which were caused by the PvdA), which resulted in a recount of all the votes cast. Back then the PvdA only beat Livable Rotterdam by a mere 650 votes, yet both parties had 14 seats in the city council. Joost Eerdmans was elected lijsttrekker of Livable Rotterdam on October 6, 2013. Under his leadership, the party won the 2014 municipal election, retaining its fourteen seats. Since May 8, 2014, Livable Rotterdam leads a coalition with CDA and D66."

Each team had progressed through five rounds to reach the final, having each entered in the third round. Both teams required a single replay in different rounds to progress, but otherwise won each of their games. In the fifth round, Cardiff knocked the reigning champions, Bolton Wanderers out of the cup. Both teams had a mixture of home and away games on their route to the final, but Arsenal were not required to play outside of London after the initial fourth round match. By the quarter-finals, the two teams were the only Football League Division One teams left in the competition. Arsenal had injury problems with Horace Cope ruled out. Additional trains were put on to get Cardiff's fans to Wembley, and police reinforcements to keep fans at bay who had been sold fake tickets. A concert was held prior to the game, which included the first rendition of Abide with Me, which has since become a cup final tradition. It was the first FA Cup Final broadcast on the radio, which coined the phrase \""back to square one\"".

Both teams had opportunities to score, but the only goal of the game was credited to Hughie Ferguson after the ball slipped out of the hands of goalkeeper Dan Lewis, and he knocked the ball into the net with his elbow. Afterwards, he blamed his new wool jersey, saying that it was greasy. This resulted in the Arsenal tradition of washing goalkeeper jerseys before every match. Following the match, the press called it the \""Singing Final\"" and highlighted that the FA Cup had gone to Wales for the first time. In the following years, Cardiff suffered a decline in their fortunes and didn't reach the FA Cup final again until 2008.

9,6,"Columba de Dunbar (c. 1386 – 1435) was Bishop of Moray from 1422 until his death at Spynie Palace near Elgin sometime before 7 November 1435. Columba was \""of Royal race\"", the youngest \""lawful son of George de Dunbar, 10th Earl of March\"" and his spouse Christian née Seton. His father, who supported the so-called English Party in Scotland, later changed his allegiance and went over to King Henry IV of England. Along with his elder brothers, Columba moved to England in 1400. On 28 June 1401 Columba collected £100 given by King Henry to his father the Earl \""for his special favour\"" and on 3 October 1401 Columba collected a further sum of £25/9s/7d for him. \""Cristiana countess of Dunbarre\"" was also awarded £40/19s/3d \""for her charges and expenses coming from the North\"" &c., and Columba collected this at the same time. On 26 February 1403 (1402/3), while studying at Oxford, \""Columba son of George de Dunbarre earl of March of Scotland\"" was granted \""the Deanery of the free chapel of St. Mary Magdalene of Bridgnorth\"". This was thought to be a reward for the help provided by his father to King Henry in the battle of Homildon Hill in 1402. Columba returned to Scotland in 1409 and by 1412 he was Dean of Dunbar collegiate church when he witnessed the foundation charter of St Andrews University. In addition, he was the Deacon of the chapel of Ruthven, St. Andrews. On 1 May 1419, by Papal Dispensation, he was given the additional rectory of the parish church of Locherworth or Borthwick (£30 per annum), from which he was promoted to the post of Archdeacon of Lothian. He Supplicated the Pope to be able to retain his former combined annual incomes which were in excess of £100 in addition to £120 for the Archdeaconry. Not only were these allowed but he continued to petition for other positions to be \""annexed\"" to his Archdeaconry for further large sums. His request to retain the Deanery of Dunbar for another year, in April 1422, was contested. His appointment as Archdeacon was contested by another priest, Edward de Lawedre, who believed the appointment had been promised to him. The litigation continued until Columba's promotion to the See of Moray. Columba became Bishop of Moray on 3 April 1422 but no record of his consecration exists. On 1 December 1433, a Safe-conduct was issued by the young King Henry VI for Columba and his entourage of 30 servants \""to pass through England on his way to the Roman Court\"" (Keith says as envoy of King James I of Scotland). He died before November 1435 and is thought, according to Keith, to have been buried in the aisle of St Thomas the Martyr (Becket) in Elgin Cathedral."

He currently serves as the midfield coach of the West Coast Eagles. He is the younger brother of former AFL footballer, and Richmond 2009 caretaker coach, Jade. Rawlings was recruited to the Kangaroos in the 1998 AFL Draft, with the 15th selection. Rawlings completed year 12 (final year of school) whilst in his first year at the club (1999). Rawlings made a name for himself becoming one of the league's best taggers, but as his game grew in 2003 he started to win much more of his own ball, to hurt the opposition defensively and offensively. In 2004, he had his best season to date, gaining selection for the International rules series and taking out the Syd Barker Medal for the North Melbourne best and fairest. In 2005, Rawlings had another solid year, albeit not as good as the previous, but 2006 saw him recapture the career-best form to take out his second Syd Barker Medal. Rawlings was a solid contributor in 2007 and 2008, but after some retirements, he was forced to be played in a variety of different roles. In 2009, a rebuilding year for the club, he spent much time playing in defense shutting down some of the game's most eluding players in Cyril Rioli and Aaron Davey. Rawlings played his 200th AFL game in North Melbourne's five point win over St Kilda in round 21. He continued in this defensive role in 2010, but was also able to get the ball himself, having a career high 623 possessions and sharing his third Syd Barker Medal with Brent Harvey. Rawlings retired from football at the end of the 2011 season when North Melbourne finished 9th on the ladder. After retiring, he joined North Melbourne as the senior recruiting and induction coach- which he held during the 2012/13 seasons. At the end of the 2013 season, Rawlings left North Melbourne to accept a role at the West Coast Eagles as an assistant coach under new senior coach and former teammate and captain of Rawlings Adam Simpson. Rawlings still holds this role today."

Osmunda nipponica Makino) is a fern in the genus Osmunda native to east Asia, including Japan, China, Korea, Taiwan, and the far east of Russia on Sakhalin. It is a deciduous herbaceous plant which produces separate fertile and sterile fronds. The sterile fronds are spreading, up to 80-100 cm tall, bipinnate, with pinnae 20-30 cm long and pinnules 4-6 cm long and 1.5-2 cm broad; the fertile fronds are erect and shorter, 20-50 cm tall. It grows in moist woodlands and can tolerate open sunlight only if in very wet soil. Like other ferns, it has no flowers, but rather elaborate sporangia, that very superficially might suggest a flower, from which the alternative name derives. Like its relative Osmundastrum cinnamomeum (Cinnamon fern), the fertile fronds become brown-colored and contain spores. The sterile (vegetative) fronds resemble in form, another relative, Osmunda regalis (Royal fern).

Born in the small town of Florennes, Lambot worked as a saddler. He worked 12 hours a day, starting at 6am. He bought his first bicycle at 17 and began riding 50 km a day to and from work. His first race was in a local village; he won five francs as first prize. He then bought a racing bike. He began racing professionally in 1908. In that year he won the championships of Flanders and Belgium. He rode the Tour de France from 1911 to 1913 but the First World War ended the race for the next five years. When the Tour returned in 1919 it was a miserable affair of war-torn roads, fractured logistics and former contenders no longer alive to compete. Only 11 riders finished. Lambot was approached at the Buffalo track in Paris, where he had ridden a 24-hour race, to ride the Tour in the Globe Cycles team. He was second for much of the race but took the lead when Eugène Christophe broke a fork. Observers felt Lambot owed his victory more to Christophe’s bad luck than his own ability and a collection for Christophe surpassed the prize money Lambot received. His performance brought him a contract from the larger Peugeot team at 300 francs a month. He was engaged to ride just the Tour de France. In the 1920 and 1921 Lambot placed respectably and in 1922 he won for the second time after Hector Heusghem was handed an hour penalty for swapping his bicycle after breaking the frame. He became the first to win the Tour without winning a stage. Lambot was 36 when he won the 1922 Tour, the oldest winner of one of the big cycling tours (i.e. the tours of France, Spain and Italy) at that time. He kept the record for over 90 years, until it was broken by 41-year-old Vuelta winner Chris Horner in 2013. He remains the oldest Tour winner to date. By the end of his career he was paid 1 800 francs a month by his team. In retirement, he returned to work as a saddler."

8,52,"Petit Manseng (sometimes translated: Small Manseng, rarely \""Little Manseng\"") is a white wine grape variety that is grown primarily in South West France. It produces the highest quality wine of any grape in the Manseng family. The name is derived from its small, thick skin berries. Coupled with the small yields of the grapevine, most Petit Manseng farmers produce around 15 hl of wine per hectare. The grape is often left on the vine till December to produce a late harvest dessert wine. The grape is grown primarily in Gascony, Jurançon and Pacherenc du Vic-Bilh but has recently drawn interest in New World wine regions like California, North Georgia, Virginia, Ohio, and Australia. The reason is that it is expected to follow Viognier's path to popularity among white wine drinkers. It was already present in Uruguay, when Basque settlers brought \""Manseng\"" and Tannat vines with them to their new home. Despite being easily recognizable as a white grape while true Manseng is a black grape, wine that is Petit Manseng is still normally labeled as just \""Manseng\"".
