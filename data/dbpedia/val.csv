7,39,"43954 Chýnov, provisional designation 1997 CT5, is an asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, roughly 6 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by the two Czech astronomers Miloš Tichý and Zdeněk Moravec at the Kleť Observatory in South Bohemia, on 7 February 1997. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.1–2.4 AU once every 3 years and 5 months (1,251 days). Its orbit shows a low eccentricity of 0.06 and is tilted by 7 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. Little is known about the asteroids size, composition, albedo and rotation, despite having a well-observed orbit with the lowest possible uncertainty – a condition code of 0 – and an observation arc that spans over a period of two decades. Based on its absolute magnitude of 14.3, its diameter could be anywhere between 4 and 8 kilometers, assuming an albedo in the range of 0.05 to 0.25. Since inner-belt asteroids typically have a spectral type of a brighter rocky, rather than a darker carbonaceous body, its true diameter may be at the lower end of NASA's generic conversion table, as, for a given absolute magnitude, an object's diameter decreases, when its albedo increases. The minor planet is named after Chýnov, a south Bohemian village in the Czech Republic, well known for its limestone cave, Chýnovská jeskyně."

It was designated a Grade II-listed building on 3 December 1992, and was reported to be closed in March 2011 due to electrical defects. At the time this church was built, the amount of funds available was the determining factor when deciding on the architectural style to be used when building a new place of worship; the richer the congregation, the more ornate the church. Most churches cost somewhere between £1000 and £2000 to erect, but the Church of All Saints, Llanelli was estimated to cost £4,800 when it was built in 1872, the architect being George Edmund Street of London. Additional sums were spent in 1887 when the west end was completed according to the original plans. The exterior is built with brown rock-faced rubble-stone with Bath stone dressings, and the roof is clad with green slates and terracotta ridge tiles. Besides the \""exceptionally fine 5-light stained-glass east window\"" there is another fine window in the south aisle.

9,40,"Saint Tikhon's Orthodox University of Humanities (Russian: Православный Свято-Тихоновский гуманитарный университет) in Moscow, Russia is a coeducational theological university for the laity affiliated with the Russian Orthodox Church. The university, established in 1991, is Russia's first theological graduate-level school for the lay men and women, unlike traditional Orthodox seminaries preparing male students for ordination. It is the only Orthodox institution in Russia that is accredited to issue generally accepted diplomas. Ten departments of the university provide education in theology, history, teaching, missionary practice, religious arts and music, economics, social services and information management. Basic theology studies are mandatory for students of all departments. Admission does not require adherence to Orthodox faith or any religious tests, except for the icon school where applicants should demonstrate skills in traditional Orthodox art. The university traces its roots to Orthodox missionaries Vsevolod Schpiller (1902–1984) and hieromonk Paul (Troitsky) (1894–1991). In the end of the 1980s their alumni set up evening courses of theology that merged in a unified institution in 1991 and, with support of Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow, acquired state accreditation as a university in 1992. The University is closely associated with the Brotherhood of Merciful Saviour, which traditionally provided teaching staff and premises to the University. For years, the university operated on premises leased from other colleges or on the parish church properties, notably the church of Saint Nicholas in Kyzneci(Zamoskvorechye District) operated by the Brotherhood. In the 2000s the University obtained the rights to the former Bishopric House that prior to the October Revolution housed the Orthodox Open University and is now (2009) in the process of rebuilding the run-down building into its new, permanent, campus. The university has been continuously chaired by one of its founders, and the founding member of the Brotherhood of Merciful Saviour, Revd. Vladimir Vorobyov (born 1941) since 1991. Rector of the University is, as of 2009, an ex officio member of the Local Council (pomestny sobor) of the Russian Orthodox Church. Vladimir Vorobyov also chairs the department of religion and culture at the Ministry of Internal Affairs Academy. The university selects its staff primarily from ordained Russian Orthodox clerics and lay academicians; guest speakers may come from other denominations (i.e. Roman Catholic Church). University staff was actively engaged in the 2007 public controversy on the alleged Orthodox clericalisation of school education, opposing the nonsectarian approach of the Russian Academy of Sciences. In 2006 the late Patriarch Alexey, speaking in favor of increased Orthodox presence in public schools, proposed Saint Tikhon's university as the source of qualified lay teachers of the Basics of Orthodox Culture course recommended by the Church. The university celebrates its holiday on November 18, the day of Saint Tikhon's ascension to the Patriarchy in 1917."

It was then relaunched by Weldon under its more commonly known name as an offset quarterly in 1989. Both versions of the magazine covered what Weldon dubbed \""Psychotronic Movies\"", which he defined as \""the ones traditionally ignored or ridiculed by mainstream critics at the time of their release: horror, exploitation, action, science fiction, and movies that used to play in drive-ins or inner city grindhouses.\"" Weldon coined the term after being inspired by The Psychotronic Man (1980), a low budget science fiction obscurity. Most of the magazine's hundreds of reviews were written by Weldon himself. In each issue, other contributors provided career histories/interviews with cult directors and actors such as Radley Metzger, Larry Cohen, Jack Hill, William Rotsler, David Carradine, Sid Haig, Karen Black, and Timothy Carey. Regular features included Record Reviews by Art Black, Spare Parts (fanzines and comics) by Dale Ashmun, and Never To Be Forgotten, an extensive obituary column by Weldon that covered the deaths of writers, directors, television and film actors, rock stars, comic book artists, lawyers, and anybody else Weldon felt was related to the overall Psychotronic-universe. In December 2006, Weldon announced that he was ceasing publication of Psychotronic Video after 18 years and 41 issues. Citing increasingly expensive printing costs and dubious business practices from distributors as his main source of concern, he noted that \""It was a struggle to self-publish in the 80s and 90s but now it’s nearly impossible.\"" In an interview conducted by The Augusta Chronicle in November 2012, Weldon stated that he had no interest in writing or publishing any additional books or magazines devoted to genre films. Instead he said he was concentrating on running a small store in downtown Augusta, Georgia named simply \""Psychotronic\"", which specializes in selling collectibles such as vinyl records, classic movie posters and old comic books."

This was the first legislative election after the Council for National Security, a military junta, had overthrown Thailand's elected government and abrogated the constitution on September 19, 2006. The junta had canceled general elections scheduled for October 2006 and promised new elections within 12 months. The Constitutional Tribunal then outlawed the Thai Rak Thai party, the largest political party in Thailand, and banned TRT executives from contesting in the elections for five years. After their political party had been dissolved, the former TRT members regrouped under the band of People's Power Party (PPP) led by Samak Sundaravej, the seasoned politician. Following its formation, the junta issued a classified order to suppress the activities of the PPP and to frame it for lèse majesté. The order was leaked to the public, leading to a complaint towards the Election Commission from the PPP. However, the Election Commission dismissed the complaint on the grounds that the Council for National Security (CNS) had granted itself immunity in the 2007 Constitution of Thailand. The junta deployed 200,000 soldiers and police officers to maintain security and 1,500 officers to supervise after election fraud. Charnchai Silapauaychai, a popular former Democrat Party member from Phrae who switched to the PPP for the 2008 election, was assassinated.

3,4,"Abrams v. United States, 250 U.S. 616 (1919), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States upholding the 1918 Amendment to the Espionage Act of 1917, which made it a criminal offense to urge curtailment of production of the materials necessary to the war against Germany with intent to hinder the progress of the war. The 1918 Amendment is commonly referred to as if it were a separate Act, the Sedition Act of 1918. The defendants were convicted on the basis of two leaflets they printed and threw from windows of a building in New York City. One leaflet, signed \""revolutionists\"", denounced the sending of American troops to Russia. The second leaflet, written in Yiddish, denounced the war and US efforts to impede the Russian Revolution. It advocated the cessation of the production of weapons to be used against Soviet Russia. The defendants were charged and convicted of inciting resistance to the war effort and urging curtailment of production of essential war material. They were sentenced to 10 and 20 years in prison. The Supreme Court ruled, 7–2, that the defendants' freedom of speech, protected by the First Amendment, was not violated. Justice John Hessin Clarke in an opinion for the majority held that the defendants' intent to hinder war production could be inferred from their words, and that Congress had determined such expressions posed an imminent danger. Their conviction was accordingly warranted under the \""clear-and-present-danger\"" standard, derived from the common law and announced in Schenck v. United States and companion cases earlier in 1919. Opinions for a unanimous Court in those cases were written by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. In the Abrams case, however, Holmes dissented, rejecting the argument that the defendants' leaflets posed the \""clear and present danger\"" that was true of the defendants in Schenck. In a powerful dissenting opinion joined by Justice Louis Brandeis, he said that the Abrams defendants lacked the specific intent to interfere with the war against Germany, and that they posed no actual risk. He went on to say that even if their acts could be shown to pose a risk of damaging war production, the draconian sentences imposed showed that they were being prosecuted not for their speech, but for their beliefs."

4,11,"In his critical edition of the play published by the Early English Text Society in 1969, Eccles argues for a date between 1465 and 1470. Wickham, in his Dent edition of 1976, agrees, finally settling on 1470. Similarly, Lester, in his New Mermaids edition of 1981, offers between 1464 and 1471. Baker and, following his suggestion, Southern agree on a date of 1466. These arguments are based upon references to coinage in the playtext, specifically the \""royal\"" and the \""angel\"", which were minted between 1465 – 1470. The poem certainly dates from the reign of Edward IV of England, and likely has an East Anglian provenance; it was likely \""intended to be performed in the area around Cambridge and the environs of Lynn in Norfolk.\"" This is evidenced by numerous local place names dispersed throughout the play, including that of Bury St Edmunds, significant for being the home of two former owners of the play: Thomas Hyngman (15th century) and Cox Macro (18th century). Like Wisdom, Mankind bears a Latin inscription by the monk Thomas Hyngman and the phrase (translated), “Oh book, if anyone shall perhaps ask to whom you belong, you will say, “I belong above everything to Hyngham, a monk.”  Similarities between this hand and the text of the play lead scholars to believe that Hyngman transcribed the play. However, several textual oddities likely derive from Hyngman's miscopying of the text because he was unfamiliar with it, so scholars do not credit Hyngman with authorship. Along with The Castle of Perseverance and Wisdom, Hyngman's Mankind was acquired by the Reverend Cox Macro in the early 18th century. Macro bound them together somewhat arbitrarily, along with three other non-dramatic manuscripts. Early 19th-century owner Henry Gurney separated The Castle, Wisdom, and Mankind from the other manuscripts and bound them together as a collection in a separate volume. In 1936, the Folger Shakespeare Library purchased this manuscript at a Sotheby's auction for 440 pounds."

In 2009 and 2010, through a special agreement with the UCI, individuals from those teams could compete as part of teams that were limited to three competitors, which led to a resurgence of interest among male cyclists in the Tour of the Gila. Beginning in 2011, though, individuals from UCI ProTeams were completely prohibited from competing in such races. The Gila planned to upgrade to a UCI Americas Tour race in 2011 as a result, but it was not able to secure sufficient funding and had to revert to a U.S. national race.

9,47,"Mieszko I (; ca. 930 – 25 May 992) was the ruler of the Polans from about 960 until his death. A member of the Piast dynasty, he was a son of Siemomysł, a grandchild of Lestek, the father of Bolesław I the Brave (the first crowned king of Poland), the father of Gunhild of Wenden with his wife Oda (most sources make him the father of Sigrid the Haughty, a Nordic Queen, though one source identifies her father as Skoglar Toste) and the grandfather of Cnut the Great (Gundhild's son), and the great-grandfather of Gunhilda of Denmark, Canute the Great's daughter and wife of Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor. The first Christian ruler of Poland, Mieszko I is considered the de facto creator of the Polish state. He continued the policy of both his father and grandfather, who were rulers of the pagan tribes located in the area of present-day Greater Poland. Through both alliances and the use of military force, Mieszko extended ongoing Polish conquests and early in his reign subjugated Kuyavia and probably Gdańsk Pomerania and Masovia. For most of his reign, Mieszko I was involved in warfare for the control of Western Pomerania, eventually conquering it up to the vicinity of the lower Oder river. During the last years of his life, he fought the Bohemian state, winning Silesia and probably Lesser Poland. Mieszko I's marriage in 965 to the Czech Přemyslid princess Dobrawa and his baptism in 966 put him and his country in the cultural sphere of Western Christianity. Apart from the great conquests accomplished during his reign (which proved to be fundamental for the future of Poland) Mieszko I was renowned for his internal reforms, aimed at expanding and improving the so-called war monarchy system. According to existing sources, Mieszko I was a wise politician, a talented military leader, and a charismatic ruler. He successfully used diplomacy, concluding alliances, first with Bohemia, then Sweden, and the Holy Roman Empire. In foreign policy, he placed the interests of his country foremost, even entering into agreements with his former enemies. On his death, he left to his sons a country with greatly expanded territories, and a well-established position in Europe. Mieszko I also enigmatically appeared as \""Dagome\"" in a papal document dating to about 1085, called Dagome iudex, which mentions a gift or dedication of Mieszko's land to the Pope (the act took place almost a hundred years earlier)."

Their music combined elements of rock, jazz fusion and ethnic Macedonian music. As the band matured, the jazz influences became less obvious. However, in concert, Leb i sol performances of jazzed-up and lengthy versions of traditional ethno-folk classics such as \""Jovano Jovanke\"" or \""Aber Dojde Donke\"", were often received with great enthusiasm and cheer. Leb i sol were very popular in the 1970s and 1980s and, while not selling as many records as some pop and folk acts, were very well known and respected and often sold-out venues in most of the larger cities in the former Yugoslavia. The first two albums are often considered foundational, while most are diverse enough to be, at least in part, accessible to a fairly wide audience. The influence of ethnic music and folk music of Republic of Macedonia are recognizable in the use of odd meters (5/4, 7/8) and non-traditional scales (e.g. the Phrygian dominant scale). While all the musicians were fairly accomplished, Vlatko Stefanovski is frequently regarded as an exceptional guitar virtuoso."

9,8,"Holger Hieronymus (born 22 February 1959, in Hamburg) is a former German football player. Hieronymus started his career with local side TuS Hamburg at the age of six and was a promising talent for the sweeper position when the then Hamburger SV general manager Günter Netzer snapped him up from local counterpart FC St. Pauli for DM 75,000 following Hamburger SV's Bundesliga title in 1979. The next Bundesliga season saw the technically gifted player playing his first games, being a starter in the European Cup final defeat of his side against Nottingham Forest at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium on 28 May 1980. Failing to claim the Bundesliga trophy of 1980 and 1981, on both occasions Hamburg finished second, Hieronymus won his first trophy in 1982 when Hamburg won the league. That same summer he and his side crashed to Sven-Göran Eriksson's IFK Göteborg in the two-legged UEFA Cup final. In 1983 his club retained the Bundesliga title and, further, beat Juventus in the European Cup final in Athens. He was back as a regular in the line-up's of Hamburg manager Ernst Happel after his career had, for some time, been called to a halt due to his club signing veteran German legend Franz Beckenbauer in November 1980. The most tragic moment of his playing days, however, happened on 31 March 1984, in the Bundesliga tie against SV Waldhof Mannheim. With less than fifteen minutes left on the clock, Hieronymus received a career-ending injury. A cruciate ligament rupture synchronized with a deltoid ligament rupture and, together with, a caused menisci and knee cartilage damage forced him to retire in 1985, over a year after that incident. At the time he finally abandoned the hope of recovery, merely 26 years of age, the talented sweeper had played in 121 Bundesliga matches (seven goals) for Hamburger SV. For West Germany Holger Hieronymus was capped three times in between September 1981 and October 1982, each as a substitute and just the final of those (he came on for injured Karlheinz Förster in the fifth minute in a friendly win over England at Wembley on 13 October 1982) for a duration of more than parts of the second-half. Still, he was selected by Jupp Derwall for the 1982 FIFA World Cup, staying unused throughout the competition. Looking for a different occupation after his premature retirement, Hieronymus first founded a sports center for the obese and was later, together with his former team-mate Ditmar Jakobs (whose career had also abruptly been ended by horrible injury), co-founder of an injury rehabilitation centre. Leaving these jobs aside, Hieronymus enjoyed a return to Hamburger SV in 1997 as the new marketing manager of Die Rothosen. From June 1998 to August 2002 he operated as general manager of the club. On 1 February 2005, he took a leading position at DFL Deutsche Fußball Liga GmbH, which can be seen as the governing entity that governs the Bundesliga competition."

9,47,"William Taylor (1760 – 19 July 1842) was an officer in the Royal Navy who served during the American War of Independence and the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Entering the navy early in his life, Taylor served as a midshipman on Cook's third voyage of discovery. He was promoted shortly after his return to England and commanded ships during the American War of Independence. In common with other officers, he struggled to find employment during the years of peace, but was given a ship to command for a few years in 1788. He was on bad terms with his lieutenant however, and a court-martial ensued. Taylor returned to an active career on the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, still commanding small ships and escorting trade. Promoted to post captain in 1793, he moved to command several frigates in British waters, or as far afield as North America. His later service was on the African coast, where he took part in the capture of Gorée in 1801, and in the Caribbean. He does not appear to have held any seagoing commands during the Napoleonic Wars, but continued to be promoted, rising to flag rank in 1811. He eventually reached the rank of admiral of the red, before his death in 1842. He was by this time the last surviving officer from Cook's third voyage."

As the first SoundLink Game released via Satellaview, BS Zelda no Densetsu in particular was identified by Nintendo as the world's first integrated radio-game. During this time, starting on March 2, 1997, a non-SoundLink port of Zelda no Densetsu: Kamigami no Triforce was also broadcast via Satellaview. Broadcasts of Kamigami no Triforce continued periodically throughout the tenure of Nintendo's partnership with St.GIGA (which ended on May 30, 1999) and then St.GIGA independently broadcast the game until May 29, 2000. With the exception of Kamigami no Triforce all Zelda titles broadcast to the Satellaview were Satellaview-exclusive.

There has been much fan debate about whether or not the Zelda titles for the Satellaview (collectively known as the BS Zelda games) should be considered enhanced remakes or spin-off titles, whether or not their plots (different plots from the prior titles in 3 of the 4 Satellaview games) should be regarded as canonical or not, and if so where they should fit into the timeline of Zelda events."

The tunnel connects the Zaan district with the western part of Amsterdam. The tunnel reaches a maximum depth of 22 metres. Before the tunnel was built the Hem ferry and, to a lesser degree, the Schellingwouder bridge was the most important connection between Amsterdam and Zaandam which formed a serious bottleneck for traffic. In 1959 5.800 vehicles were ferried daily and waiting times reached 45 minutes or more. In the 1950s inhabitants petitioned successfully for a tunnel under the North Sea Canal. Construction commenced in 1961 and the total cost amounted to 45 million Dutch guilders. The opening of the tunnel was inaugurated on the 21st of June 1966 by Queen Juliana. Since its opening the tunnel has been a great success. Currently with more than 100.000 vehicles passing daily congestion is once more an issue.

He served as a General in the Union Army during the American Civil War (1861–65), for which he received recognition for his outstanding command of military strategy as well as criticism for the harshness of the \""scorched earth\"" policies that he implemented in conducting total war against the Confederate States. Sherman began his Civil War career serving in the First Battle of Bull Run and Kentucky in 1861. He served under General Ulysses S. Grant in 1862 and 1863 during the battles of Forts Henry and Donelson, the Battle of Shiloh, the campaigns that led to the fall of the Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg on the Mississippi River, and the Chattanooga Campaign, which culminated with the routing of the Confederate armies in the state of Tennessee. In 1864, Sherman succeeded Grant as the Union commander in the Western Theater of the war. He proceeded to lead his troops to the capture of the city of Atlanta, a military success that contributed to the re-election of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln. Sherman's subsequent march through Georgia and the Carolinas further undermined the Confederacy's ability to continue fighting. He accepted the surrender of all the Confederate armies in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida in April 1865, after having been present at most major military engagements in the Western Theater. When Grant assumed the U.S. presidency in 1869, Sherman succeeded him as Commanding General of the Army, in which capacity he served from 1869 until 1883. As such, he was responsible for the U.S. Army's engagement in the Indian Wars over the next 15 years, in the western United States. He steadfastly refused to be drawn into politics and in 1875 published his Memoirs, one of the best-known first-hand accounts of the Civil War. British military historian B. H. Liddell Hart famously declared that Sherman was \""the first modern general\""."

7,39,"NGC 613 is a barred spiral galaxy located some 67 million light years away in the southern constellation of Sculptor. It is a candidate outlying member of the Sculptor Group, a gravitationally-bound group of galaxies. This galaxy was discovered in 1798 by German-English astronomer William Herschel, then re-discovered and catalogued by Scottish astronomer James Dunlop. It was first photographed in 1912, which revealed the spiral form of the nebula. During the twentieth century, radio telescope observations showed that a linear feature in the nucleus was a relatively strong source of radio emission. NGC 613 is inclined by an angle of 37° to the line of sight from the Earth along a position angle of 125°. The morphological classification of NGC 613 is SBbc(rs), indicating that it is a spiral galaxy with a bar across the nucleus (SB), a weak inner ring structure circling the bar (rs), and moderate to loosely wound spiral arms (bc). The bar is relatively broad but irregular in profile with a position angle that varies from 115–124° and dust lanes located along the leading edges. Star formation is occurring at the ends of the bar and extending along the well-defined spiral arms. The central bulge is readily apparent, with a radius of 14″. The classification of the nucleus is of type HII, indicating a match to the spectrum of an H II region. Near the core, the stars have a velocity dispersion of 136 ± 20 km/s. The nucleus is a source of radio emission with the form of an inner ring with a radius of about 1,100 ly (350 pc) and a linear feature that is perhaps perpendicular to it. The latter consists of three discrete blobs spanning approximately 2,000 ly (600 pc). Observations suggest the presence of a supermassive black hole at the core with a mass in the range (1.9–9.6) × 107 times the mass of the Sun."

The music was composed by Svika Pick, and the lyrics written by Yoav Ginai. It totalled 172 points in the polling. The song became the last entry entirely in a language other than English to win the Contest until 2007. The interval act and Dana's reprise was the last time live music from an orchestra was used in the Contest, as the 1999 Contest lacked the necessary budget and was held in a venue not large enough to hold one. The selection of Dana International's song caused so much controversy amongst conservative groups in Israel that on her arrival in Britain, police escorts and security were required continuously. The performance consisted of Dana International wearing a silver dress, backed by four other female singers wearing black. It involved no dancing. The song was the eighth entry performed on the night, following Poland's Sixteen with \""To takie proste\"" and preceding Germany's Guildo Horn with \""Guildo hat euch lieb!\"".

It was re-enacted by Dana International along with six dancers equipped with giant feathered fans and a live orchestra as the original footage was shown in the background.

Their legend states that they were martyred at Rome under the Emperor Diocletian towards the end of the third century, most likely in the year 286. They are mentioned in most of the ancient martyrologies, including the Roman Martyrology, and their martyrdom is described in the Acts of St Sebastian, which, though ancient, are largely legendary."

When Bayswater was abolished at the 1968 election, he successfully stood for the new seat of Ascot, which covered roughly the same territory. A former deputy chairman of committees, Toms was elevated to the speakership following Labor's victory at the 1971 election. During a Legislative Assembly sitting in October 1971, he collapsed and was rushed to Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, where he subsequently died. Because Toms's death reduced Labor to a minority government, the premier, John Tonkin, advised the governor, Sir Douglas Kendrew, to prorogue parliament until the necessary by-election had been held.

7,39,"2010 TK7 is a near-Earth asteroid and the first Earth trojan discovered; it precedes Earth in its orbit around the Sun. Trojan objects are most easily conceived as orbiting at a Lagrangian point, a dynamically stable location (where gravitational and centrifugal forces balance) 60 degrees ahead of or behind a massive orbiting body, in a type of 1:1 orbital resonance. In reality, they oscillate (librate) around such a point. Such objects had previously been observed in the orbits of Mars, Jupiter, Neptune, and the Saturnian moons Tethys and Dione. 2010 TK7 has a diameter of about 300 meters (1,000 ft). Its path oscillates about the Sun–Earth L4 Lagrangian point (60 degrees ahead of Earth), shuttling between its closest approach to Earth and its closest approach to the L3 point (180 degrees from Earth) about every 400 years. The asteroid was discovered in October 2010 by the NEOWISE team of astronomers using NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)."

1,26,"The men's 50 kilometres race walk at the 2004 Summer Olympics as part of the athletics program was held through the streets of Athens with the start and finish at the Athens Olympic Stadium on August 27. The race had started in the virtually empty Olympic Stadium with fifty-four walkers lining up the field. The Chinese trio of Han Yucheng, Yu Chaohong, and A Latangadasu hurtled away from the pack to take the front as they left the stadium. In the early laps, Han made a tactical move to continuously lead the Chinese walkers within five minutes, but he received his first of three warnings, fell off back to the pack, and was later disqualified after the red paddle. Ten minutes into the race, the Chinese duo were soon joined by four other walkers, Russia's world record holder Denis Nizhegorodov and his teammate Aleksey Voyevodin, 20 km bronze medalist Nathan Deakes of Australia, and defending Olympic champion Robert Korzeniowski. Between 10 and 30k, Nizhegorodov and Korzeniowski moved to the front of the pack and stayed abreast each other through most of the race. At the halfway point, the leading group had been whittled down to four. Korzeniowski was still in the lead with the Russian duo and Deakes attempting to overtake him. While Nizhegorodov and Voyevodin created a gap as they separated from the group to gain a thirty-second advantage, it came down to a chase between Korzeniowski and Deakes to take the lead with only one hour to go. Deakes was eventually disqualified after his third warning with the red card, and Korzeniowski steadily broke away from the field to own the remaining third of the race. At around 35k, Korzeniowski had commanded a 30-second lead over the weary Nizhegorodov and a further 22 seconds over Yu Chaohong. Walking tirelessly in fourth, Voyevodin managed to bridge back to the pack and launched a charge to strengthen his pace closely behind Yu. Coming through the 45k mark and into the Olympic Stadium, Korzeniowski increased his lead by fifteen seconds ahead of the world record holder before storming his way at the final turn to cross the finish line for the last time in his competitive career. With a historic win, he added a fourth gold medal to his Olympic tally in 3:38:46. Five minutes behind Korzeniowski, Nizhegorodov appeared unstable on the home stretch, but had accumulated much ground to finish strong with a silver medal, before collapsing to the track in exhaustion. Meanwhile, his fast-charging teammate Voyevodin surpassed the confident Yu just outside the stadium to claim the bronze with a tremendous finish, edging the Chinese off the podium by eleven seconds."

5,24,"An item number or an item song, in Indian cinema, is a musical performance that is often shown as a part of the movie but most of the times without any importance to the plot of the movie. The term is commonly used in connection with Hindi, Kannada, Tamil and Telugu cinema, to describe a catchy, upbeat, often sexually provocative dance sequence for a song in a movie. The main aim of an item number is to entertain and also to lend support to the marketability of the film. However, the term as understood in Bollywood parlance has entered the Kathmandu entertainment industry scenario as well. Item numbers are usually added to Indian movies to generate publicity by featuring them in the trailers. Item numbers are favoured by filmmakers for the reason that since they do not add to the plot, they afford the filmmakers with the opportunity to pick potential hit songs from the stocks. It is thus a vehicle for commercial success which ensures repeat viewing. A female actor, singer or dancer, especially someone who is poised to become a star, who appears in an item number is known as an item girl. There are item boys as well. However, second generation South Asian females are more commonly featured in item numbers than males. Item numbers usually feature one or more persons other than the lead actors. Sometimes established female and male actors will lend a \""special appearance\"" to an item number. Although, the origin of the term \""item number\"" is obscure, it is likely that it derives its meaning from objectification of women. This is because item in filmy Mumbai slang is used by Indian men to objectify women. The classic meaning of item number refers to highly sexualized songs with racy imagery and suggestive lyrics. The item number would feature an item girl who appeared in the film as a dancer, usually in a bar or nightclub, and was only in the film for the length of that song."

Worcestershire declared their first innings at 388/1 (Turner 202*) and eventually won by an innings, so Senghera did not get to bat, but he claimed five wickets in the match, his maiden scalp being that of Peter Hayes. A couple of weeks later he played against Oxford University and did even better, taking 8-108 in the match; his first-innings 5-81 remained his only five-wicket haul. He made no further county appearances that year, but did turn out (albeit rather ineffectually) for DH Robins' XI against the Pakistanis at Eastbourne. In 1975, Senghera again played only a handful of games, and ten first-class wickets at 57.40 was a less than satisfactory return. There were a couple of minor bright spots only: he hit a fighting 36 not out as part of an unbroken last-wicket stand of 58 with Norman Gifford (30*) against Gloucestershire, and he also took the first of only two career one-day wickets when he dismissed Kent's John Shepherd in June. (His other one-day wicket was that of Clive Rice of Nottinghamshire in 1976, but the gap between them was only two days short of a year.) 1976 saw Senghera enjoy his only extended run in the Worcestershire team, making 16 first-class and eight List A appearances, but he did not make the most of this opportunity. Although more effective than in the previous season, he remained somewhat expensive with the ball, averaging 42.73 for his 34 first-class wickets, while in the one-day game he sent down 28.3 overs but took only the aforementioned wicket of Rice, for a total cost of 146 runs. As a batsman he fell away badly in scoring only 221 runs in 20 first-class innings and 40 in five List A games. Senghara's last game was in early September 1976, when he picked up the single wicket of Zaheer Abbas in Worcestershire's nine-wicket defeat by Gloucestershire."
1,48,"The 2009 Glasgow North East by-election was a by-election for the Parliament of the United Kingdom's House of Commons constituency of Glasgow North East. The by-election was held on 12 November 2009 following the resignation of Michael Martin as an MP and as Speaker of the House of Commons following the MPs' expenses scandal. Martin was the first Speaker since Sir John Trevor in 1695 to be forced from office. Willie Bain, the Scottish Labour Party candidate, won with 59% of the vote. Just 33% of the electorate voted, which is the lowest ever percentage turnout in a Scottish by-election to the House of Commons. There was a longer than normal gap between a seat falling vacant and the by-election. On 22 July, during a brief debate in the House of Commons, the UK Government refused to move the writ before the summer recess. It is a convention (not always observed in practice) that mainstream political parties do not contest elections against sitting Speakers of the House of Commons. As such, Michael Martin won Glasgow North East without his former Labour Party label, and neither the Conservative nor Liberal Democrat parties had fought the constituency (or its predecessor, Glasgow Springburn) in either 2001 or 2005. This was the last by-election of the 2005–2010 parliament."

7,38,"Shihmen Dam (Chinese: 石門水壩; literally: \""Stone Gate Dam\""; also spelled Shimen or Shihman) is a major rock fill dam across the Dahan River in northern Taoyuan City. It forms the Shihmen Reservoir (石門水庫), Taiwan's third largest reservoir or artificial lake. It provides irrigation in Taoyuan, flood control for the Taipei Basin, and hydroelectricity and domestic water supply for more than three million people in northern Taiwan. Completed in 1964 after nine years of construction, Shihmen was Taiwan's first multi-purpose water project and a major step towards the island's economic independence after World War II. Year-round water releases from the dam enabled additional rice harvests and doubled Taoyuan's annual agricultural output, while the reservoir became a major tourist destination due to its scenic beauty and plentiful fisheries. However, the project was criticized for its high cost and its impact on local communities, as more than 2,000 people were displaced to make way for the reservoir. Like many other reservoirs in Taiwan, Shihmen has suffered from sedimentation, reducing its capacity by over a third. Efforts to reduce the rate of sediment accumulation, including dredging, check dam construction and watershed restoration work, have had a limited effect. This has diminished both the Shihmen Dam's capability to contain floods and provide water during droughts."

This species was first observed by the ornithologists Zhou Fang and Jiang Aiwu while surveying the Nonggang Natural Reserve (弄岗自然保护区) in the Guangxi, China, in February 2005. The type specimen was captured in January 2006, and the species was formally described in 2008. In appearance it is similar to the sooty babbler (S. herberti), but differs in having a pale iris, a white crescent behind the ear, a white throat patch with black spots, and a black bill. In general behaviour it resembles a wren-babbler of the genus Napothera in that it prefers running to flying, and seems to spend most of its time on the ground foraging for insects between rocks and under fallen leaves. Its natural habitat is karst seasonal rainforest that, following selective cutting, is dominated by Burretiodendron hsienmu. The known range is currently restricted to the Nonggang Natural Reserve, but since similar habitat also exists in northern Vietnam and south-east Yunnan, China, it is possible the species may also be found there."

4,45,"The Ballades, Op. 10 are lyrical piano pieces written by Johannes Brahms during his youth. They were dated 1854 and were dedicated to his friend Julius Otto Grimm. Their composition coincided with the beginning of the composer's lifelong affection for Clara Schumann, the wife of Robert Schumann, who was helping Brahms launch his career. Frédéric Chopin had written the last of his famous ballades only 12 years earlier, but Brahms approached the genre differently from Chopin, choosing to take its origin in narrative poetry more literally. Brahms's ballades are arranged in two pairs of two, the members of each pair being in parallel keys. The first ballade was inspired by a Scottish poem \""Edward\"" found in a collection Stimmen der Völker in ihren Liedern compiled by Johann Gottfried Herder. It is also one of the best examples of Brahms's bardic or Ossianic style; its open fifths, octaves, and simple triadic harmonies are supposed to evoke the sense of a mythological past. \n*  No. 1 in D minor. Andante \n*  No. 2 in D major. Andante \n*  No. 3 in B minor. Intermezzo. Allegro \n*  No. 4 in B major. Andante con moto The tonal center of each ballade conveys an interconnectedness between the four pieces: the first three each include the key signature of the ballade that follows it somewhere as a tonal center, and the fourth ends in the key signature of D major/B minor despite cadencing in B major. Brahms returned to the wordless ballade form in writing the third of the Six Pieces for Piano, Op. 118. His Op. 75 vocal duets titled \""Ballads and Romances\"" include a setting of the poem \""Edward\""—the same that inspired Op. 10, No. 1. A number of famous pianists have played some or all of the Ballades, including Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli, Artur Rubinstein, Emil Gilels, Sviatoslav Richter, Glenn Gould, Wilhelm Kempff, Idil Biret, Julius Katchen, Krystian Zimerman, Claudio Arrau, and Martin Jones."

A Sunni Islamist party, it is well organised through a network of mosques and seek to promote a conservative social agenda while not directly challenging the Kingdom's government. The party won four seats in Bahrain's 2006 general election, down from eight seats in 2002. At times, Al Menbar has seemed significantly more liberal than either the pro-business Independent Bloc and the salafist Asalah, particularly in its opposition to proposed legislation that it argues would restrict freedom of assembly. MP Mohammed Khalid's forthright expression of views has attracted controversy particularly over his campaigns against the filming of Big Brother in Bahrain, to ban a concert by Lebanese singer, Nancy Ajram and his support for government against Shia opposition. In February 2006, Al Menbar led parliament's refusal to ratify the government's signature of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, with the party's president, Dr Salah Alli, explaining, \""[The Convention] means that Muslims could convert to another religion, something against the Islamic law, since those who do so should be beheaded.\"" On the issue of women's political rights in Bahrain, Al Menbar MP Dr Ali Ahmed told the Bahrain Tribune (26 January 2006): Granting women their political rights is not against Islamic precepts. Women should be motivated to achieve their aspirations and contribute to the Kingdom’s development. We support women’s political empowerment and want to field the best women who can win. We believe that having a female head of state or president is against religious regulations, but any post below that is open to women. In 2006's general election, the party promised to field several female candidates, with eye specialist Dr Haifa Al Mahmood apparently selected; however after an electoral pact was worked out with Asalah, which opposes women candidates, Al Menbar produced an all male list of candidates. The party has though backed women's rights activists' campaign for the introduction of a unified personal status law, which was vehermently opposed by Shia Islamists. In 2006's election they have worked out a deal with the Salafist Asalah to avoid splitting the Sunni Islamist vote."

7,1,"Fårö Lighthouse (Swedish: Fårö fyr) is a Swedish lighthouse located on the easternmost tip of Fårö. In the 19th century there had been many complaints from sea authorities that the coastlines on Gotland had very few lighthouses. So the decision was made to build one on the north side of Gotland. This lighthouse was constructed one year after the one on Hoburgen at the south tip of Gotland. The light ran on a colza oil lamp at first. In 1882 a paraffin lamp replaced the old one, and in 1953 it was electrified. From 1891 to 1976 the tower had a first-order Fresnel lens installed in its lantern which made the lighthouse very powerful. It is remote-controlled since 1976 and owned by the Swedish Maritime Administration."

8,57,"Urostylididae is a family of true bugs and is considered a basal or \""primitive\"" family within the stink-bug lineage. They are found only in Asia. Older works used the spelling Urostylidae but this clashes with the name used for a protozoan family and a spelling correction (emendation) has been suggested that also avoids the confusion created by homonyms. The family name Urolabididae has also been used for some members in the past. This family has about a hundred species that have a distribution limited mainly to eastern Asia. Urostylids are somewhat longer (4 to 15 mm) than broad with elongated legs with three tarsal segments and a small head. The antenna has 5 segments of which the first is longer than the head. The base of the antenna has broad tubercles and has a ringed appearance. The simple eyes or ocelli, when present (Urolabida lacks ocelli), are very close to each other. On the underside they show a wide separation between the hind and mid coxae. Other important family characters are the presence of a structure for stridulation, the stridulitrum on the first anal vein of the hind wing and bristles on the claws. The female genital structure has nine gonocoxites that form a M or W-shaped sclerite. They suck plant sap. The male reproductive anatomy suggests close affinities to the Tessaratomidae subfamily Natalicolinae. The spermatheca has two pump flanges in two genera which is a feature found also in the Aradidae and Leptopodidae. Thus the phylogeny of the group is unclear but lies within the Pentatomoidea. In the past the family was divided into two subfamilies, but one group, the Saileriolinae, has since been suggested as a distinct family, Saileriolidae, by at least two studies. The position of Saileriolidae within the Pentatomoidea is still unclear."

1,48,"The Battle of Chusto-Talasah (also known as Bird Creek, Caving Banks, and High Shoal) was fought December 9, 1861, in what is now Tulsa County, Oklahoma (then Indian Territory) during the American Civil War. It was the second of three battles in the Trail of Blood on Ice campaign for the control of Indian Territory during the American Civil War. A series of battles were fought in December in bad weather between the Confederate Cherokee and Choctaw Indians and the Union Creek and Seminole Indians (led by the Muscogee Creek chief Opothleyahola) who supported the Federal government. Following Opothleyahola and his Union force’s defeat at Round Mountain, he retreated northeastward in search of safety. On December 9, 1861, the force was at Chusto-Talasah (Caving Banks) on the Horseshoe Bend of Bird Creek when Col. Douglas H. Cooper’s 1,300 Confederates attacked about 2:00 p.m. Chief Opothleyahola knew Cooper was coming and had placed his troops in a strong position in heavy timber at Horseshoe Bend. For almost four hours, Cooper attacked and attempted to outflank the Federals, finally driving them across Bird Creek just before dark. Cooper camped there overnight but did not pursue the Federals because he was short of ammunition. The Confederates claimed victory. Chief Opothleyahola and his band moved off in search of security elsewhere. Their loss was estimated by Cooper as 500 (some accounts suggest 412). Confederate casualties were 15 killed and 37 wounded. Although the Confederates had gained a minor tactical victory, they would win a resounding one later in the month at Chustenahlah. The Chusto-Talasah battle site is on privately owned land near 86th Street North and Delaware Avenue, 5 miles northwest of modern Tulsa."

2,43,"The 2014–15 season was Oxford United's fifth season in League Two after returning from the Conference, and their first under new manager Michael Appleton. They finished 13th in the table, following an 8th-place finish in League Two in 2013–14. It was the club's 121st year in existence, their 115th of competitive football and their 66th since turning professional. This article covers the period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015. In July 2014, private equity broker Darryl Eales took over the club from previous owner Ian Lenagan and installed Mark Ashton as Chief Executive and former Portsmouth, Blackpool and Blackburn Rovers manager Michael Appleton as head coach. The new management team had little time to assemble a side, with Danny Hylton (signed by outgoing manager Gary Waddock to replace long-serving forward James Constable) the only new player among the first-team squad at the time of the takeover. The season opened badly: a series of four narrow defeats left United pointless and at the foot of the League Two table and fearing a second relegation to non-League football. Matters gradually improved, but the team never reached the top half of the table and calls were heard during the season for Appleton's dismissal. An unbeaten run of eight games (including five wins) at the end of the season eased relegation fears and led to a 13th-place finish, the club's highest position during the season. This late upturn, alongside the solid strike record of leading scorer Hylton and the performances of loanees Tyrone Barnett and Kemar Roofe (the latter to sign permanently after the season ended), gave cause for optimism for the following season, and dampened criticism of what was ultimately an underwhelming season. United beat Grimsby Town of the National League in the first round of the FA Cup, but were eliminated by fellow League Two side Tranmere Rovers after a second-round replay. After an eye-catching first-round away victory over higher-division opposition in the shape of eventual League One champions Bristol City, the club were narrowly eliminated from the League Cup in the second round, losing 7–6 on penalties to Premier League side West Bromwich Albion after a hard-fought 1–1 draw at The Hawthorns.

Like the true woodpeckers, piculets have large heads, long tongues which they use to extract their insect prey and zygodactyl feet, with two toes pointing forward, and two backwards. However, but they lack the stiff tail feathers that the true woodpeckers use when climbing trees, so they are more likely than their relatives to perch on a branch rather than an upright trunk. Their bills are shorter and less dagger-like than the true woodpeckers, so they look for insects and grubs mainly in decaying wood. Similarly, they re-use woodpecker holes for nesting, rather than making their own holes. The eggs are white, as with many hole nesters.

During his career at University of Michigan, he was named Freshman of the Year in 1991, had Frozen Four appearances in 1992 and 1993 and the Wolverines were CCHA Tournament Champions in 1994. He finished his U-M career with 248 points including a school-record 164 assists. He was drafted by the New York Rangers in the 12th round of the 1991 NHL Entry Draft after his freshman season, but remained at U-M to complete his stellar career. Wiseman would next move to play hockey professionally. He played for the Chicago Wolves (IHL), St. John's Maple Leafs (AHL), Toronto Maple Leafs (NHL), and Houston Aeros (IHL) before retiring due to concussion problems stemming from an injury suffered during the Aeros' 1999–2000 playoff season.

8,57,"The superb fairy-wren (Malurus cyaneus), also known as the superb blue-wren or colloquially as the blue wren, is a passerine bird of the family Maluridae, common and familiar across southeastern Australia. The species is sedentary and territorial, also exhibiting a high degree of sexual dimorphism; the male in breeding plumage has a striking bright blue forehead, ear coverts, mantle, and tail, with a black mask and black or dark blue throat. Non-breeding males, females and juveniles are predominantly grey-brown in colour; this gave the early impression that males were polygamous, as all dull-coloured birds were taken for females. Six subspecies groups are recognized: three larger and darker forms from Tasmania, Flinders and King Island respectively, and three smaller and paler forms from mainland Australia and Kangaroo Island. Like other fairy-wrens, the superb fairy-wren is notable for several peculiar behavioural characteristics; the birds are socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous, meaning that although they form pairs between one male and one female, each partner will mate with other individuals and even assist in raising the young from such pairings. Male wrens pluck yellow petals and display them to females as part of a courtship display. The superb fairy-wren can be found in almost any area that has at least a little dense undergrowth for shelter, including grasslands with scattered shrubs, moderately thick forest, woodland, heaths, and domestic gardens. It has adapted well to the urban environment and is common in suburban Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne. The superb fairy-wren eats mostly insects and supplements its diet with seeds."

7,28,"The Göta älv (Swedish pronunciation: [ˈjøːta ˈɛlv], River of the Geats) is a river that drains lake Vänern into the Kattegat, at the city of Gothenburg, on the western coast of Sweden. It was formed at the end of the last glaciation, as an outflow channel from the Baltic Ice Lake to the Atlantic Ocean and nowadays it has the largest drainage basin in Scandinavia. The Göta älv is located in Götaland, with the river itself being a site of early Geatish settlement. The length is 93 km. Usually the combination of Göta älv and Klarälven (a river ending at Vänern) is considered to be one river system. This combination is the longest river in the Nordic countries, 750 km. The Bohus Fortress is located by the river at Kungälv. There the river splits into two, with the northern part being the Nordre älv and the southern part keeping the name Göta älv. At Trollhättan there is a dam, canal locks and a hydropower station in the river. The locks make the river navigable, even for large cargo vessels (88 m long). The artificial parts are called Trollhätte Canal. The river and the canal is part of a mostly inland waterway, Göta Canal, which spans the width of Sweden to the Baltic Sea south of Stockholm. The power station supplied electric power to the heavy steel industry concentrated around Trollhättan Falls, contributing to its industrial revolution. In the summer months the spillway of the dam is opened for a few minutes daily and tourists gather to see the water rushing down the river (picture). There are concerns about whether the maximum discharge of 1000 m³/s is enough in a scenario where heavy rain floods the lake Vänern, causing considerable damage. Previously this was thought not to be possible in reality, but in 2001 the lake was flooded almost a meter above maximum level (and some upstream lakes like Glafsfjorden 3 metres). In this situation, Göta älv was allowed a discharge of 1100 m³/s for months causing big risk of landslides. Now a water tunnel between Vänersborg and Uddevalla is considered as a rescue solution. There is a large risk of landslides along the river and historical notes of 15 landslides exist. The largest occurred in the years 1150, 1648, 1950, 1957 and 1977 (Tuve landslide)."

The by-election was the first seat to change hands in the 2005 Parliament when Willie Rennie won the seat for the Liberal Democrats, a gain from Labour, by 1,800 votes. The BBC reported a swing from Labour to the Liberal Democrats of 16.24%. It was the first time Labour had lost a seat at a Westminster by-election in Scotland since the Scottish National Party won the Glasgow Govan by-election in 1988, and the first time Labour has ever lost to the Liberal Democrats, or their predecessors the Liberal Party, in a Scottish Westminster by-election. The by-election took place in the middle of a leadership election in the Liberal Democrats and the party was perceived in the media to be declining in the polls as a result of negative publicity surrounding the resignation of former leader Charles Kennedy and revelations about the private lives of Mark Oaten and Simon Hughes. The constituency of Dunfermline and West Fife was first created for the United Kingdom Parliament at the 2005 general election and saw a comfortable Labour win at that election.

The route passes through mostly rural areas of farmland and mountains in Warren County. It also passes through Washington, where Route 57 crosses Route 31. The route is designated a scenic byway, the Warren Heritage Scenic Byway, by the state of New Jersey due to the physical environments it passes through as well as from historical sites along the way such as the Morris Canal. The current alignment of Route 57 was designated as a part of pre-1927 Route 12 in 1917. In 1927, Route 24 was designated along this route between the Phillipsburg area and Penwell in Mansfield Township while a spur of Route 24 called Route S24 replaced pre-1927 Route 12 between Penwell and US 46 in Hackettstown. When New Jersey renumbered its state highways in 1953, the portion of Route S24 between Penwell and CR 517 in Hackettstown became a part of Route 24 to complete a gap in that route while Route S24 north of there became Route 57. A never-built segment of Route 57 running from the intersection of Route 24 and Route 57 to US 46 east of Hackettstown was legislated in 1965. Around 1970, Route 57 was designated along Route 24 west of Hackettstown while the portion of Route 57 in Hackettstown became Route 182."

9,13,"Josh Thurgood (born 5 June 1985) is a former Australian rules footballer in the Australian Football League. Drafted onto the Hawthorn Football Club's Rookie List for the 2004 season, Thurgood suffered a serious knee injury in Round 2 of the VFL season playing for the Box Hill Hawks. In 2005, he was elevated from the Rookie List by the Hawks for the 2005 season and made his AFL debut in Round 1 of that year. Noted for his exceptional courage and attack on the ball, Thurgood mainly played in defence for the Hawks. His weaknesses were considered to be his slight frame, weighing just 70 kilograms. Thurgood was also a cult figure for his appearance, which consisted of a thin build and red dreadlocks. His nicknames around the club included \""Red Baron\"", \""Scarecrow\"", \""Otzi\"" and \""Sideshow Bob\"", which are all borne of his appearance and added to his cult status. In his third game in the AFL, Round 3 of 2005 against Essendon, Thurgood suffered injuries after Matthew Lloyd, in his return from a forearm injury, made flush contact with Thurgood's face. This led to controversy since Lloyd was wearing a forearm guard that may have increased the impact of the collision. Lloyd was later cleared by the AFL Match Review Panel of any wrongdoing as the forearm guard was approved by the AFL prior to Lloyd wearing it. Thurgood returned to the side two weeks later after undergoing surgery for a depressed fracture of the cheekbone, missing only one match from the injury. His stint in the side was brief, and he was dropped after Round 7 before returning for a one-off game in Round 13. He suffered a hamstring injury before Hawthorn's Round 15 clash. He returned to Box Hill and returned to the Hawthorn line up in Round 21, stringing together the last two games of the season. In 2006, Thurgood had shoulder surgery during the pre-season. He recovered to return to the side in Round 10, but played just two games for the season (the other one being in Round 11). He struggled for form and was delisted at the end of the year. However, he was redrafted by Hawthorn in the 2007 Pre-season Draft. He played two more games in 2007, but was delisted again at the end of the year. He never played in a win for Hawthorn after finishing his career with 0 wins and 13 losses. After being delisted by Hawthorn, Thurgood signed for the Port Adelaide Magpies in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) for the 2008 season. Thurgood's great great uncle is former Essendon champion Albert Thurgood."
7,9,"The Harry W. Kelley Memorial Bridge is a bridge in the U.S. state of Maryland. It carries 4 lanes of U.S. Route 50, plus two sidewalks, across Sinepuxent Bay, connecting the downtown area of Ocean City, Maryland to the mainland of Worcester County, Maryland within West Ocean City, and is mere feet from the national eastern terminus of said route. It is one of four entrances to the resort town, and the southernmost of them all; the others are Maryland Route 90, Delaware Route 54, and Delaware Route 1. The bridge features a drawbridge span near the Ocean City end. The bridge is named for Harry W. Kelley, a former mayor of Ocean City. The current bridge in this location, built in 1942, replaces an earlier bridge that was slightly downstream of the current site, which used what is now Maryland Route 707 (Old Bridge Road) to cross the Sinepuxent Bay and connect to downtown Ocean City as Worcester Street. At the time of its construction, the bridge carried U.S. Route 213; it was changed to its current number in 1948 when the extension of US 50 replaced US 213 south of Queen Anne's County. Currently the bridge is a busy center of activity in the city, and is utilized by many fishermen, joggers, and cyclists. The bridge is the target of much discussion due to its age and structural issues, as well as its antiquated design. In August 2010, the Maryland State Highway Administration decided to construct a new drawbridge to replace the current structure. The new drawbridge was selected over a higher fixed span, which would have cost more and have displaced more properties. The bridge is not expected to be constructed until at least 2035, with $300 million in funding for planning of the bridge. When the new bridge is complete, the existing structure is planned to be turned into a fishing pier with the central part of the bridge removed."

Klakring, the only child of Colonel and Mrs. Leslie Klakring, was born in Annapolis, Maryland graduated from the United States Naval Academy with the Class of 1927. Lieutenant Commander Klakring commanded USS Guardfish (SS-217), from her commissioning in May 1942 through her fourth war patrol in March–April 1943. Guardfish's first war patrol was in the hitherto unpatrolled waters off northeast Honshū and southern Hokkaidō. Klakring worked out a tactic of getting inside of the sea lanes at night — just off the shore — to put his ship in position to attack the many ships moving along the coast. On 4 September, Klakring attacked a convoy off Kuji, sinking two ships; a third which had retreated into the harbor was then hit and sunk from a range of over 7,500 yards. In all, Guardfish sank five major cargo ships with a total tonnage of almost 17,000 tons, and damaged others. It was one of the most successful patrols of the war, and on Guardfish's return, Klakring was decorated with the Navy Cross. In a rare press conference called to publicize the accomplishments of the ordinarily \""Silent Service\"", he embellished his success, spinning a yarn about being close enough to a town to see a horse race being run, \""but we were just a little too far away to be sure which horse won.\"" On his second patrol, Klakring took Guardfish to the East China Sea, where he attacked a seven-ship convoy on 21 October, sinking two ships. For her outstanding success on these first two war patrols, Guardfish received a Presidential Unit Citation. Guardfish was sent to the Bismarck Sea for her third patrol. There Klakring sank another cargo ship and two Japanese naval vessels — Patrol Boat No. 1 and the destroyer Hakaze — near Kavieng, New Ireland. In November 1944, Klakring led a seven-sub wolfpack — \""Burt's Brooms\"" — from the Marianas to the Japanese home islands. Klakring chose John S. Coye's Silversides as his flagship; the others were Saury, Tambor, Trigger, Burrfish, Sterlet, and Ronquil. Their mission was to 'sweep' Japanese patrol craft out of the way of a planned raid by Admiral William Halsey's Fast Carrier Task Force. However, according to Jasper Holmes, one of the cryptographers at Station HYPO, \""The Japanese responded to the raid by rushing additional patrol craft and air search planes into the area, and there were probably more pickets in the area after the sweep than there were when it started.\"" On retirement, Captain Klakring received a tombstone promotion to the rank of rear admiral. He later served as vice president of the General Dynamics Corporation's Electric Boat Division. Klakring died on 24 July 1975 at Balboa Naval Hospital in San Diego, California."

However, the transfer of coach–general manager Robbie Nichols to the UHL expansion Chicago Hounds in February 2006 started speculation that the RiverDogs franchise would be transferred to become the Hounds for the 2006–07 season, which indeed proved to be the case. Nichols left the Chicago franchise in April 2006 to become general manager of the UHL Elmira Jackals and the First Arena in Elmira, New York. Late in the 2006–07 season, the Hounds were sold to Craig Drecktrah, owner of the Rockford IceHogs. Drecktrah folded the Hounds after one season due to problems securing a lease with the Sears Centre in suburban Chicago. In April 2006, the Richmond Coliseum's management announced that the RiverDogs had missed several opportunities to renew their lease for 2006–07, thus folding the franchise. The RiverDogs were replaced by the second incarnation of the Richmond Renegades, which began play in the Southern Professional Hockey League in October 2006.

9,49,"The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) is the highest internal-control institution of the Communist Party of China (CPC), tasked with enforcing internal rules and regulations and combating corruption and malfeasance in the Party. Since the vast majority of officials at all levels of government are also Communist Party members, the commission is in practice the top anti-corruption body in China. The modern commission was established at the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee in December 1978. Control systems had existed previously under the name \""Central Control Commission\"" for a brief period in 1927 and again between 1955 and 1968, and under its present name from 1949 to 1955. It was disbanded during the Cultural Revolution in 1969. In 1993, the internal operations of the agency and the government's Ministry of Supervision (MOS) were merged. Although the commission is theoretically independent of the Party's executive institutions such as the Central Committee and its Politburo, historically the work of the CCDI has been directed by the Party's top leaders. However, beginning with Hu Jintao's term as General Secretary of the Communist Party of China in November 2002, and especially following Xi Jinping's assumption of the party leadership in November 2012, the CCDI has undergone significant reforms to make it more independent from party operations below the Central Committee. According to the Party's Constitution, the members of the CCDI are elected by the National Congress and serve for a term of five years. After the national congress in which it is elected, the CCDI convenes to elect its Secretary, deputy secretaries, secretary general and Standing Committee. Elected officials must then be endorsed by the Central Committee to take office. The Secretary of the CCDI has, since 1997, been a member of the Politburo Standing Committee and, since 2009, served as the leader of the Central Leading Group for Inspection Work.

Ou Kaapse Weg begins at a T-junction with Steenberg Road in Westlake, close to the southern end of the M3 expressway. It rapidly ascends the northern face of the Steenberg mountains, through two hairpin bends, to the summit at an elevation of 315 metres (1,033 ft). Near to the summit are entrance gates to the Silvermine Nature Reserve.

9,7,"WKXQ (1600 AM) was an American radio station licensed to serve the community of Reidsville, North Carolina. WKXQ was one of three radio stations licensed to operate in the city and one of seven that once operated in Rockingham County, North Carolina. The station was licensed to broadcast on 1600 kHz. Its power output was 1,000 watts and used a three tower antenna system, broadcasting both day and night at full power from the transmitter site located on North Carolina Highway 87, west of Reidsville. The station was initially licensed in 1947 as WFRC. The original studios were located in downtown Reidsville at the northern corner of South Scales and Gilmer Streets. The programming audio was fed by a telephone loop to the transmitter site on NC Highway 87 (West Harrison Street) which also served as residence for the engineering staff. In the early 1970s, the owners of WFRC moved the studios and offices to the transmitter site. Around 1979 or 1980, the station owners changed the call letters to WKXQ, which was changed again to WRNC in 1982. In 1987, due to intense competition from FM stations in the nearby Greensboro, North Carolina market, the station signed off for several months under silent authority. But with threats of permanent license revocation from the FCC, the station signed back on the air as a daytime broadcast only station. With failing equipment and no revenue, WRNC finally signed off the air several months later and the owners surrendered the license to the FCC. In the early 1990s, all of the station's equipment and property, including all three towers, was auctioned off to the public. The property is now privately owned and all that remains are the building which has been gutted. All three towers were dropped and removed from the premises.

7,23,"Col de Tende (Italian: Colle di Tenda; elevation 1870 m) is a high mountain pass in the Alps, close to the border between France and Italy, although the highest section of the pass is wholly within France. It separates the Maritime Alps from the Ligurian Alps. It connects Nice and Tende in Alpes-Maritimes with Cuneo in Piedmont. A railway tunnel inaugurated in 1898 and a Road Tunnel inaugurated in 1882 run under the pass. The latter tunnel is 3.2 kilometre long and is among the oldest long road tunnels. French historian François Guizot states that the road was first developed by Phoenicians and later maintained by Greeks and Romans. But, at the end of three or four centuries, these colonies fell into decay; the trade of the Phoenicians was withdrawn from Gaul, and the only important sign it preserved of their residence was a road which, starting from the eastern Pyrenees, skirted the Gallic portion of the Mediterranean, crossed the Alps by the pass of Tenda, and so united Spain, Gaul, and Italy. After the withdrawal of the Phoenicians this road was kept up and repaired, at first by the Greeks of Marseilles, and subsequently by the Romans."

7,28,"The Waitaki River is a large braided river that drains the Mackenzie Basin and runs some 110 kilometres (68 mi) south-east to enter the Pacific Ocean between Timaru and Oamaru on the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand. It starts at the confluence of the Ohau River and the Tekapo River, now in the head of the artificial Lake Benmore, these rivers being fed by three large glacial lakes, Pukaki, Tekapo, and Ohau. The Waitaki flows through Lake Benmore, Lake Aviemore and Lake Waitaki, these lakes being contained by hydroelectric dams, Benmore Dam, Aviemore Dam and Waitaki Dam. The Waitaki has several tributaries, notably the Ahuriri River and the Hakataramea River. It passes Kurow and Glenavy before entering the Pacific Ocean. The river’s flow is normally low in winter, with flows increasing in spring when the snow cloaking the Southern Alps begins to melt, with flows throughout the summer being rainfall dependent and then declining in the autumn as the colder weather begins to freeze the smaller streams and streams which feed the catchment. The median flow of the Waitaki River at Kurow is 356 cubic metres per second (12,600 cu ft/s). The middle of the river bed formed a traditional political boundary between Canterbury and Otago. As such, the term \""South of the Waitaki\"" is often used to refer to the Otago and Southland regions as one common area (the two regions share historical and ethnic relationships which make them distinct from the regions to the north of them). The river is popular for recreational fishing and jetboating."

1,48,"The Battle of Günzburg on 9 October 1805 saw General of Division Jean-Pierre Firmin Malher's French division attempt to seize a crossing over the Danube River at Günzburg in the face of a Habsburg Austrian army led by Feldmarschall-Leutnant Karl Mack von Lieberich. Malher's division managed to capture a bridge and hold it against Austrian counterattacks. The battle occurred during the War of the Third Coalition, part of the larger Napoleonic Wars. After Mack's Austrian army invaded Bavaria, it found itself the target of a powerful offensive by the army of Emperor Napoleon I of France. When Napoleon's corps threatened to envelop Mack's army, the Austrian general unwisely held his ground near the city of Ulm. As the French armies blocked the Austrian retreat routes to the east, Mack attempted to move his army to the south bank of the Danube. After receiving orders to seize the Danube bridges, Marshal Michel Ney sent Malher to capture the crossing at Günzburg. Malher's main attack on two bridges failed in the face of a vigorous Austrian defense. However, a late-arriving French unit captured the eastern bridge that had just been rebuilt by the Austrians and was able to hold on to it until evening. Discouraged by the encounter, Mack ordered his soldiers to march back to Ulm which is 22 kilometers west-southwest of Günzburg."

9,40,"Lancing College is a co-educational English independent school in the British public school tradition, founded in 1848 by Nathaniel Woodard. Woodard's aim was to provide education \""based on sound principle and sound knowledge, firmly grounded in the Christian faith.\"" Lancing was the first of a family of more than 30 schools founded by Woodard (others include Hurstpierpoint College, Ardingly College, Bloxham School and Worksop College). The school is based in 550 acres (2.2 km2) of countryside in West Sussex, east of Worthing near the village of Lancing, on the south coast of England. The college is situated on a hill which is part of the South Downs, and the campus dominates the local landscape. The college overlooks the River Adur and the Ladywell Stream, a holy well or sacred stream within the College grounds has pre-Christian significance. The school is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference. Girls were first admitted in 1970. The school is dominated by a Gothic revival chapel, and follows a high church Anglican tradition. The College of St Mary and St Nicolas (as it was originally known) in Shoreham-by-Sea was intended for the sons of upper middle classes and professional men; in time this became Lancing College, moving to its present site in 1857. The school's buildings of the 1850s were designed by the architect Richard Cromwell Carpenter, with later ones by John William Simpson. Lancing educates c.550 pupils between the ages of 13 and 18; the co-educational ratio is c.60:40 boys to girls.Roughly 60% of pupils are boarders, at a cost of £32,910 per year; c.40% are day pupils, at a cost of £23,130 per year. Occasional overnight stays are available to day pupils at an additional cost. In 1998 Lancing commissioned the choral piece Triodion to mark its 150th anniversary. In 2003 it was one of fifty of the country's leading independent schools which were found guilty of running an illegal price-fixing cartel which had allowed them to drive up fees for thousands of parents, although the schools made clear that they had not realised that the change to the law (which had happened only a few months earlier) about the sharing of information had subsequently made it an offence. Each school was required to pay a nominal penalty of £10,000 and all agreed to make ex-gratia payments totalling three million pounds into a trust designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in respect of which fee information was shared. Jean Scott, the head of the Independent Schools Council, said that independent schools had always been exempt from anti-cartel rules applied to business, were following a long-established procedure in sharing the information with each other, and that they were unaware of the change to the law (on which they had not been consulted)."

8,57,"Valenciennea is a genus of small, bottom-dwelling fish in the family Gobiidae. They are found over sandy bottoms, often at coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific. The members of the genus tend to rest directly on the substrate for extended periods of time. While this is a common behavior for members of the family, this genus also float motionless directly above the substrate, which is why they are sometimes called glider gobies. Their resting behavior has resulted in the vernacular name \""sleeper gobies\"", which invites confusion with the related family Eleotridae. The members of this genus are known to be carnivorous sand-sifters; to eat, they simply engulf entire mouthfuls of sand which they expel through their gills. Specialized structures in their gills filter small crustaceans and worms as the sand is expelled. It is this specific trait that makes some members of the genus attractive to the marine aquarist, and they are often introduced into a marine aquarium for sand-sifting. Some of the species are known to be monogamous. The genus was named after notable French zoologist Achille Valenciennes. These fish are difficult to keep in a tank. Tanks with plenty of live sand and live rock are recommended. Offer foods such as sinking shrimp pellets. Fish may die even if eating properly."
7,12,"Frauenstein Castle (German: Burg Frauenstein) is a ruined castle in the town of Wiesbaden-Frauenstein in Hesse, Germany. It is not known who built Frauenstein Castle, but, based on dendrochronological evidence, its construction has been dated to around 1184. Built on a quartzite outcropping of the Spitzen Stein the castle was not intended as a defensive fortress, but rather as a watch-tower. It also served the tower guards as a dwelling. The construction of the castle with its high walls and battlements gave protection to farmers in the area and led to the emergence of the village of the same name. Later, the castle was extended by a fore-castle with pond, as could be confirmed by excavations in the year 1943. While the German name Frauen-stein can be translated \""women's stone\"", it actually derives from Vrowenstein, a name which first appears in the historical record in 1221. In that year, a deed names a Heinrich Bodo von Vrowenstein (in 1207/1209, he was mentioned as being from Idstein) as a lord of Frauenstein Castle. In the year 1231, a document of the Erbach monastery mentions a knight by the name of Siegfried von Frauenstein who was a marshal with the bishopric of Mainz. He was a descendant of an aristocratic Schierstein family (which would become extinct in 1380). Around 1300, Siegfried IV von Frauenstein sold part of the castle, along with surrounding property and its serfs, to Gerhard, the Archbishop of Mainz. Gerhard wanted the castle in order to protect the eastern border of his possessions in the Rheingau against his rival, the Count of Nassau. In May 1301, forces of King Albert of Austria fought against Mainz. They captured all of the fortresses, including Frauenstein, and devastated the Rheingau. The castle was soon restored, however. In 1310 Johann von Limburg also sold his shares of the castle to the Mainz bishopric so that it had gained full control over the castle by the year 1319. Mainz, however, once again sold parts of the castle so that, by 1390, it possessed only half of the castle. The noble co-owners often settled in Frauenstein and built beautiful half-timbered houses which still stand in the village to the present day. Over the following centuries, the disputes between Mainz and Nassau continued. Nassau was able to prevent Mainz's possessions in the area from growing by encircling the castle with a chain of five fortified farms: Sommerberg, Rosenkoeppel, Nürnberg, Groroth, and Armada. All of these estates, with the exception of Rosenkoeppel, are still preserved today. In the second half of the 18th century, the castle lost its significance as border security and was no longer maintained. In the Secularization of 1803, the town was brought under the control of the Count of Nassau and in 1808 the serfs were granted freedom of movement. In 1866, the town - like all of Nassau - came under the control of Prussia."

9,49,"The Combined Action Program was a United States Marine Corps operational initiative implemented in the Vietnam War and proved to be one of the most effective counterinsurgency tools developed during that conflict. Operating from 1965 to 1971, this program was characterized by the placement of a thirteen-member Marine rifle squad, augmented by a U.S. Navy Corpsman and strengthened by a Vietnamese militia platoon of older youth and elderly men, in or adjacent to a rural Vietnamese hamlet. In most cases, the Popular Forces militia members (Nghia Quan) were residents of the hamlet who were either too young or too old to be drafted into the Army of the Republic of Viet Nam (ARVN) or the Regional Forces (Dia Phuong Quan). The entire unit of American Marines and Popular Forces militia members together was designated as a Combined Action Platoon (CAP). The program was said to have originated as a solution to one Marine infantry battalion's problem of an expanding Tactical Area of Responsibility (TAOR). The concept of combining a squad of Marines with local (PFs) and assigning them a village to protect proved to be a force multiplier. While the exact implementation varied with the stage of the war and local command variations, the basic model was to combine a Marine squad with local forces to form a village defense platoon. It was effective in denying the enemy a sanctuary at the local village level. The pacification campaign seemed to work under the CAP concept, and the Marines fully embraced it. Objectively, there is no solid proof that the CAP concept was a resounding success; however, subjectively the evidence suggests otherwise. \""Counterinsurgency operations and, in particular, the establishment of a foreign internal defense lends itself for the greatest utility of employing a CAP-style organization. Recent operations in Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia suggest a CAP-style organization could accomplish the assigned mission.\"" In Iraq and Afghanistan, the Marines reinstituted a variant of the CAP."

7,39,"1929 Kollaa, provisional designation 1939 BS, is a stony Vestian asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 7 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Finnish astronomer Yrjö Väisälä at Turku Observatory in Southwest Finland, on 20 January 1939. The bright V-type asteroid is a member of the Vesta family. Vestian asteroids have a composition akin to cumulate eucrite meteorites and are thought to have originated deep within 4 Vesta's crust, possibly from the Rheasilvia crater, a large impact crater on its southern hemisphere near the South pole, formed as a result of a subcatastrophic collision. The asteroid Vesta is the main-belt's second-most-massive body after 1 Ceres. 1929 Kollaa orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.2–2.5 AU once every 3 years and 8 months (1,326 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.08 and an inclination of 8° with respect to the ecliptic. As no precoveries were taken, the asteroid's observation arc begins with its discovery. It has a well-defined rotation period of 2.98 hours, derived from two rotational light-curve analysis. In March 2004, photometric observations at the U.S. Magdalena Ridge Observatory in New Mexico rendered a period of 2.980±0.005 hours with a brightness variation of 0.20 in magnitude (U=3). In 2008 a second, concurring period was obtained by French amateur astronomer Pierre Antonini at his private Observatoire de Bédoin in France (132). It gave a period of 2.9887±0.0004 hours and an amplitude 0.22 in magnitude (U=3). According to the surveys carried out by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the body measures 6.7 and 7.7 kilometers in diameter, respectively, and its surface has an albedo 0.39. while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.40 and calculates a diameter of 6.4 kilometers. The minor planet is named after the Kollaa River in Karelia, the focal point of violent battles during the Finnish Winter War (1939–40). Naming citation was published on 1 August 1980 (M.P.C. 5450)."

1,48,"The Action at Lanark was an assassination attack at Lanark, Scotland during the First War of Scottish Independence in May 1297. It was led by Scottish leader William Wallace who led an uprising against the English and killed Sheriff William Heselrig. At the time following the attack, it was not an isolated incident, but Wallace was joining in with risings taking place across Scotland. Not much is definitely known about this incident. The best account comes from the Scalacronica by Thomas Grey, whose father, also called Thomas Grey, was present. A fracas broke out at a court being held by Heselrig, but Wallace was able to escape with help from a girl who may have been his wife. He then came back with some supporters and attacked Heselrig and his men, killed Heselrig, nearly killed Thomas Grey senior, and set fire to some houses. Wallace then continued with his rebellion, which culminated in his victory at the Battle of Stirling Bridge four months later. It is unclear what Wallace was doing at Heselrig's court, and whether this was a spontaneous incident or if it was co-ordinated with other risings in Scotland. According to the poem The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallace, written by Blind Harry, Wallace was seeking revenge for the killing by Heselrig of his wife, Marion Braidfute of Lamington. However, there is little evidence for her existence. Harry also claims that Wallace then dismembered Heselrig's body. Fictionalised versions of this incident have appeared in various accounts of the Wallace's life, notably in the 1995 film Braveheart, where his wife was called Murron MacClannough."

7,23,"Henness Pass, elevation 6,916 ft (2,108 m), is a mountain pass northwest of Reno on the crest of the Sierra Nevada range in Sierra County, California. The pass is traversed by Henness Pass Road, a mostly unpaved road not generally passable by automobiles in winter. Portions of the road are recommended for high clearance vehicles only. Like most of the well-known Sierra Nevada passes, it lies on the Great Basin Divide. Here, the Middle Yuba River flows west to the Pacific Ocean, and the Little Truckee River flows east into the Great Basin. Historically, Henness Pass Road was a travel route used by Native Americans and then immigrants and local mining communities during the Gold Rush era. Beginning in the late 1850s, the road was a major supply route for the silver and gold mines in Nevada. Freight was brought by steamboat from San Francisco up the Sacramento River to Marysville. From there it was carried by wagons, with part of the route being via the Bridgeport Covered Bridge and the Virginia Turnpike, which connected to the road to Henness Pass at North San Juan. Henness Pass is named for Patrick Henness, who is credited with developing the route in 1849 or 1850 as an alternative to Donner Pass. In 1855 the road was officially surveyed by D.B. Scott when the California Legislature passed An Act to Construct a Wagon Road over the Sierra Nevada range, but a route through El Dorado County approximating the current path of U.S. Route 50 was ultimately chosen. The Henness Pass route was eclipsed by completion in 1868 of the First Transcontinental Railroad as far as Reno via Donner Pass. Henness Pass and its namesake road still provide the only crossing of any significance between Yuba Pass (State Route 49) to the north and Donner Summit (Interstate 80) to the south."

7,23,"The Penny Ice Cap is a 6,000 km2 (2,300 sq mi) ice cap in Auyuittuq National Park of Baffin Island, Nunavut, Canada. It forms a 2,000 m (6,562 ft) high barrier on the Cumberland Peninsula, an area of deep fiords and glaciated valleys. It is a remnant of the last ice age. During the mid-1990s, Canadian researchers studied the glacier's patterns of freezing and thawing over centuries by drilling ice core samples. The ice cap has been thinning and its valley glaciers have been retreating in recent decades related to rising summer and winter air temperatures across the eastern Arctic. The ice cap is named after Captain William Penny, a Whaling captain from Aberdeen in Scotland who pioneered over-wintering with native Inuit at Cumberland Sound in order to be able to start whaling (in the nineteenth century) much earlier in the season. He was also engaged by Lady Franklin to search for her husband John, lost with all souls in the search for the North West Passage."

8,57,"Argyresthia curvella is a species of ermine moth (family Yponomeutidae). It belongs to subfamily Argyresthiinae, which is sometimes elevated to full family rank in the superfamily Yponomeutoidea. It is commonly called apple blossom tineid, reflecting the fact that it was originally believed to be a tineid moth (family Tinieidae). This small moth is widespread in northwestern Eurasia. It is absent from Iberia and probably the entire Balkans, and generally ranges southwards only to the northern Mediterranean region; a possibly isolated population occurs in the Caucasus region. Where it occurs, it is usually not rare and may be abundant. The nocturnal adults are attracted to light sources; they are on the wing around June/July or somewhat later, depending on the location. The wingspan of adults is 10–12 mm. As usual for Yponomeutidae, the forewings have a bold black-and-white pattern, which fades easily in museum specimens though. The pattern consists of a thick oblique black line running from the center of the forewings' dorsal margin to somewhat nearer the apex on the costal margin. From the apex, a thinner and often somewhat irregular black band extends to meet the first one. The remaining areas of the forewings are generously sprinkled with small black blotches. The hindwings are pale greyish, as is the body. The caterpillars feed on Malus (apple) trees, where they eat the blossoms; it has also been suspected that they eat rotting apple wood at least occasionally. They may become a pest in apple orchards, if they occur in abundance."

9,14,"André Paul Victor Morel was born on August 3, 1884 in Troyes, France. His father died when he was 11. His parents at that time expected him Morel to become a priest or butcher. After dipping his toes into both careers, he switched to the automotive field. When Morel made his way to Lyon, he was obliged to work his way up; having no diplomas or degrees, he began washing windows and negotiating used cars. Between 1911 and 1914, Morel managed a mechanic workshop that repaired and sold automobiles and represented the brands Berliet and Le Zèbre. During World War I, he was deemed unfit for combat and was sent to work in a munitions factory. After the war, on April 1, 1919, Morel was hired as a commercial inspector by Le Zèbre. Soon, Amilcar was created by André Morel, Edmond Moyet, Emile Akar and Joseph Lamy. The name \""Amilcar\"" was formally registered on July 29, 1921, and was loosely based on an anagram, using letters (adjusted to replace the \""k\"" and the \""y\"") from the names of two of the company's founders, Lamy and Akar. As the Amilcar business grew, Morel began his great racing career. He won many races, including the French Constructor Championship in 1922. Later, on August 26, 1928 at Arpajon, speed records were officially broken: the 1270 cc was recorded achieving 211 km/h under harsh wet conditions, and the 1100cc (car) at 207 km/h. Andre Morel raced with Delage in 1925 with Albert Divo and won the San Sebastián Grand Prix. March 1929 ended Amilcar's race era. Shortly afterwards, André Morel left Amilcar.While he was racing for Amilcar, Morel was also racing for Voisin. The two companies never competed against one another.Then, Morel met back up with Lamy, and in April 1929, Morel was named representative for the Hudson and Essex brands. Driving an Essex, Morel won the automobile Tour de France.Later Morel raced with Talbot, his last race being at Le Mans in 1952. Near the end of his life, Morel was elected the vice president of the Racers Society.On August 3, 1961, André Morel died in the suburbs of Lyon, due to some illness."

9,47,"Mars Zakirovich Rafikov (Russian: Марс Закирович Рафиков, 29 September 1933 – 23 July 2000) was a Soviet cosmonaut who was dismissed from the Soviet space program for disciplinary reasons. Senior Lieutenant Rafikov, age 26, was selected as one of the original 20 cosmonauts on March 7, 1960 along with Yuri Gagarin. On March 24, 1962, Rafikov was dismissed from the cosmonaut corps, officially for \""a variety of offenses, including womanizing and 'gallivanting' in Moscow restaurants, and so forth\"". Other cosmonauts (notably Gagarin) had exhibited similar behavior, but could not be officially disciplined because of their stature and international reputation. Gherman Titov later suggested, though, that the real reason for his dismissal was because he and his wife had divorced. He remained in the military, serving as a pilot in the Afghanistan war. To protect the image of the space program, efforts were made to cover up the reason for Rafikov's dismissal. His image, like that of others who were dismissed, was airbrushed out of cosmonaut photos. This airbrushing led to speculation about \""lost cosmonauts\"" even though the actual reasons were often mundane."

The church was refurbished in about 1670 to create more space, but the large and increasing size of the congregation led to further work in 1829, and a major rebuild in 1878–80, including the widening of the nave by the addition of two outer aisles. The sandstone church has a tower at the west end, and its nave is wider than it is long due to the extra Victorian aisles.

8,57,"The pandanus leaf perforator or pandanus hole-cutter moth (Trissodoris honorariella) is a small cosmet moth species (family Cosmopterigidae). It belongs to subfamily Cosmopteriginae and is the type species of the genus Trissodoris. Baron Thomas Walsingham in 1907 had specimens from both ends of the species' range – New Guinea and the Pitcairn Island – which he described as separate species Stagmatophora honorariella and S. quadrifasciata in the same work. But his mistake was soon recognized, and when Edward Meyrick established the genus Trissodoris in 1914, he chose the former name to be valid. The habits of this moth have enabled it to be distributed far and wide by the native peoples of the Pacific. These people use the leaves of the moth's food plant Pandanus for the making of mats, baskets, and other items which for generations have accompanied voyaging islanders, and the moth has thus been widely dispersed by man. Like many related cosmet moths, this species has a short scape which bears a comb of hairs. They can be distinguished except from closely related species by their wing venation: in the forewings, vein 1b is not forked and veins 2–4 are separate, while veins 6–8 are not; the sixth and seventh vein branch off from the stalk of the eighth, while in some related genera the seventh and eighth share a single stalk."

It is mostly a cosmetic problem, causing yellowish spotting and banding on spruce needles, but in some cases can cause severe premature defoliation.

This disease is spread by wind and water splash and can further infect the spruce it currently resides on, or a neighboring spruce. Unlike other rust diseases, C. weirii is autoecious, only infecting spruce trees. C. weirii is also microcyclic, producing only two of the five possible spore stages common in rust fungi.

9,47,"Fujiwara no Mototsune (藤原 基経, 836 – February 25, 891), also known as Horikawa Daijin (堀川大臣), was a Japanese statesman, courtier and politician of the early Heian period. He was born the third son of Fujiwara no Nagara, but was adopted by his powerful uncle Fujiwara no Yoshifusa, who had no sons. Mototsune followed in Yoshifusa's footsteps, holding power in the court in the position of regent for four successive emperors. Mototsune invented the position of kampaku regent for himself in order to remain in power even after an emperor reached maturity. This innovation allowed the Fujiwara clan to tighten its grip on power right throughout an emperor's reign. Mototsune is referred to as Shōsen Kō (昭宣公) (posthumous name as Daijō Daijin)."
9,6,"Bartholomew (Greek: Βαρθολομαῖος Bartholomaíos, Latin: Bartholomaeus) was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus. He has been identified with Nathanael (alternatively spelled Nathaniel), who appears in the Gospel according to John as being introduced to Christ by Philip (who would also become an apostle), although some modern commentators reject the identification of Nathanael with Bartholomew. According to the Synaxarium of the Coptic Orthodox Church, his martyrdom is commemorated on the first day of the Coptic Calendar (i.e. the first day of the month of Thout), which currently falls on September 11 (corresponding to August 29 in the Julian Calendar). His feast is June 11 in Eastern Christianity and August 24 in the Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod, Anglican Communion and both forms of the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church. Bartholomew (Greek: Βαρθολομαῖος, transliterated \""Bartholomaios\"") comes from the Aramaic bar-Tôlmay (בר-תולמי), meaning son of Talmai or son of the furrows (perhaps a ploughman). Bartholomew was born at Cana of Galilee and is listed among the Twelve Apostles of Jesus in the three Synoptic gospels: Matthew, Mark, and Luke, and also appears as one of the witnesses of the Ascension; on each occasion, however, he is named in the company of Philip. He is not mentioned by the name Bartholomew in the Gospel of John, nor are there any early acta, the earliest being written by a pseudepigraphical writer who assumed the identity of Abdias of Babylon and to whom is attributed the Saint-Thierry Manuscript and Pseudo-Abdias Manuscripts."

Dormoy started out as a mannequin for Paul Poiret, which she credited with helping her learn to \""understand the female body.\"" Dormoy worked with Vionnet alongside other designers such as Jacques Griffe and Marcelle Chaumont. As première d'atelier, she was head of the workroom at Vionnet until she left to launch her own couture house in December 1928. This date was open to question even while Dormoy was in business, with M.D.C. Crawford stating in 1941 that Dormoy launched \""his\"" (sic) business in 1934, and the mannequin \""Freddy\"" recalling a launch date of 1927 in her 1958 memoirs. In 1937 Dormoy had her portrait painted by the artist Marie Laurencin, who accepted a fur coat as payment. This portrait was sold by the Swiss auction house Dobiaschofsky in 2013. Dormoy remained with Jean Patou in Biarritz prior to returning to Paris, France following the German occupation of France during World War II. She continued working during the Occupation, providing clothes to clients such as the actress Edwige Feuillère. In February 1946, Collier's published an article about Feuillère and Dormoy, noting that Dormoy's designs were among the first post-war models \""by leading designers\"" to be bought by American buyers for export back home, despite a poor exchange rate meaning that each design cost $500-600. A picture caption in the article noted that Dormoy's unfussy designs typically featured free-flowing lines. Dormoy closed her house in 1950, and died in 1976.

9,46,"Palmaz Vineyards is a Californian winery in the Napa Valley, primarily dedicated to Cabernet Sauvignon production. The estate is located on what was once the Cedar Knoll Vineyard Company, a pre prohibition winery, founded in 1881 by Henry Hagen, one of the pioneers of wine production in the Napa Valley. After prohibition the winery fell into a dilapidated state and the winery was abandoned. The Hagen House and the vineyards have since been restored after they were bought by Amalia and Julio Palmaz in 1997. The family operated winery and vineyards cultivate some 55 acres using sustainable farming practices, devote to Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Riesling, Muscat along with smaller plantings of Merlot, Malbec, Cabernet Franc and Petite Verdot. Palmaz Vineyards is noted for having the largest wine cave in the Napa Valley, totaling 100,000 square feet. Palmaz Vineyards' winemaking and aging takes place within the living rock of Mount George, in a multi-leveled series of tunnels and domes. The height of the wine cave is equivalent to an 18-storey building, providing the vertical range needed for true gravity-flow winemaking. Thus, the wine is not subjected to the violent agitation of pumping, which can change the wine’s intra-molecular structure. This gentle treatment allows finer nuances of flavor to develop naturally. The fermentation dome is the world’s largest underground reinforced structure. It is 72’ in diameter and 54’ high. Temperature stays constant at 60 degrees and humidity at 75%, the perfect atmosphere for aging wine. The cave houses its own water treatment plant built to comply with strict conservation guidelines.

In November 1914 he was promoted to command 6th Cavalry Brigade, then in May 1916 came further promotion to command 21st Division. He retained that command for the rest of the war. Post-war, he was knighted in 1919, and went on to hold further command and administrative positions in the army. He was General Officer Commanding (GOC) Baluchistan, 1920–24; Military Secretary, 1926–27; and GOC Aldershot Command 1927–31, when he argued for the increased mechanisation of the army.

9,7,"i102-104FM was a regional station in Ireland, launched on 7 February 2008. The station had won a licence – as part of a strategy by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to create a network of regional youth stations across the Republic – to operate a 'youth' oriented station that would broadcast across seven counties in the northwest and west of Ireland, targeting listeners aged between 15 and 34. In 2011, i102-104FM merged with its sister station i105-107FM; the combined station now broadcasts as iRadio. i102-104FM had its studios originally in Galway City, and towards the end of the station's life, Athlone. It was licensed to cover Counties Donegal, Galway, Leitrim, Longford, Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo. It was also popular in the neighbouring regions of counties Clare, Limerick, Tipperary, Offaly, Westmeath, Cavan, Monaghan and the border areas of the North. In County Donegal, because local radio station Highland Radio was already broadcasting on 103.3 MHz, i102-104 used the frequency of 96.9 MHz. High-profile figures such as the comedian Tommy Tiernan and the presenter Hector Ó hEochagáin were signed up in an effort to raise the profile of the station. There had been five competitors for the lucrative northwest licence, with bids coming from Dublin's SPIN 1038, Cork's Red FM, and the northwest station Ocean FM, through 'Vibe FM', and the €20m licence was granted to i105-107FM in November 2006. i102-104FM was owned by the iRadio consortium that has applied for several other of the regional youth licences on offer from the BAI, winning the northeast and midlands licence through i105-107FM. In August 2009 i102-104 was rated the fastest growing 15-to-34 radio station in the country, reaching over 166,000 people each week. It was also the regional radio station most listened to by 18- to 34-year-olds in Ireland."

City of Louisville, 362 U.S. 199 (1960), was a decision of the United States Supreme Court in which the Court unanimously held that it is a violation of due process to convict a person of an offense when there is no evidence of his guilt.

8,57,"Dendropicos is a genus of woodpeckers in the Picidae family that are native to Africa. The genus Dendropicos formerly contained several additional species. A 2015 molecular phylogenetic study that analysed nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences from pied woodpeckers found that Dendropicos was polyphyletic. In the rearranged genera the bearded, fire-bellied and yellow breasted woodpeckers were moved to Chloropicus while the Arabian woodpecker was moved to Dendrocoptes. The taxonomic committee of the British Ornithologists' Union have recommended an alternative arrangement of species in which the genera Dendrocoptes and Leiopicus are combined into a larger Dendropicos. The name of the genus was introduced by the French ornithologist Alfred Malherbe in 1849. The word Dendropicos is from the Greek dendron meaning tree and pikos for woodpecker. The genus contains the following 12 species: \n*  Little grey woodpecker (Dendropicos elachus) \n*  Speckle-breasted woodpecker (Dendropicos poecilolaemus) \n*  Abyssinian woodpecker (Dendropicos abyssinicus) \n*  Cardinal woodpecker (Dendropicos fuscescens) \n*  Gabon woodpecker (Dendropicos gabonensis) \n*  Melancholy woodpecker (Dendropicos lugubris) \n*  Stierling's woodpecker (Dendropicos stierlingi) \n*  Elliot's woodpecker (Dendropicos elliotii) \n*  African grey woodpecker (Dendropicos goertae) \n*  Eastern grey woodpecker (Dendropicos spodocephalus) \n*  Olive woodpecker (Dendropicos griseocephalus) \n*  Brown-backed woodpecker (Dendropicos obsoletus)"
9,46,"Editura Ion Creangă (Romanian pronunciation: [ediˈtura iˈon ˈkre̯aŋɡə]) was a publishing house based in Bucharest, Romania. Founded as a state-run company under communist rule and named after the 19th-century writer Ion Creangă, it ranked high among Romanian publishers of children's literature, fantasy literature and science fiction. Its activity resulted in many Romanian-language translations of world children's classics, among which were bestselling versions of Jules Verne's complete works and J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit. The company also stood at the core of a phenomenon in local book illustration, assigning contracts to recognized artists such as Sandu Florea, Val Munteanu, Lívia Rusz and Eugen Taru. During the late years of communism, the enterprise was subject to the intervention of official censorship. In 1988, its publishing of Ana Blandiana's poems, which featured allusions to the communist system, resulted in culturally repressive measures personally ordered by President and Communist Party leader Nicolae Ceaușescu.

The formal grouping of what were previously four separate RICs brings benefits in ensuring a more coherent approach against a common set of standards. Traditionally, TIW was considered to be part of the role known as tactical reconnaissance or tac recce. As traditional tasking and reporting has evolved to provide a much broader, more complex and often more dynamic set of questions to—and range of products from—TIW, the term Combat-aircraft ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target-Acquisition and Reconnaissance) much better describes the role of TIW and the aircraft that collect the imagery."

8,31,"Angiopteris is a genus of huge evergreen ferns from the Marattiaceae family, found throughout the paleotropics from Madagascar to the South Pacific islands. Species of smaller stature with elongate synangia and creeping rhizomes are sometimes segregated into the genus Archangiopteris, and a once-pinnate monotypic segregate genus has been called Macroglossum, but molecular data supports inclusion of these taxa within a broad concept of Angiopteris. Angiopteris evecta has been introduced and naturalized in Hawaii, Jamaica, and parts of Central America, where it has become an invasive weed in lower elevation drainages. They feature a large, erect, woody rhizome with a wide base supported by thick roots. The fronds are deltoid, pinnate, 5–8 metres (16–26 ft) long, with spreading leaflets. Angiopteris is unique among ferns in having explosively dispersed spores, thought to be caused by the cavitation of an airspace between spore layers. The basal chromosome number for this genus is 2n=80. The type species is Angiopteris evecta."

7,23,"The Mono–Inyo Craters are a volcanic chain of craters, domes and lava flows in Mono County, Eastern California, United States. The chain stretches 25 miles (40 km) from the northwest shore of Mono Lake to the south of Mammoth Mountain. The Mono Lake Volcanic Field forms the northernmost part of the chain and consists of two volcanic islands in the lake and one cinder cone volcano on its northwest shore. Most of the Mono Craters, which make up the bulk of the northern part of the Mono–Inyo chain, are phreatic (steam explosion) volcanoes that have since been either plugged or over-topped by rhyolite domes and lava flows. The Inyo Craters form much of the southern part of the chain and consist of phreatic explosion pits, and rhyolitic lava flows and domes. The southernmost part of the chain consists of fumaroles and explosion pits on Mammoth Mountain and a set of cinder cones south of the mountain; the latter are called the Red Cones. Eruptions along the narrow fissure system under the chain began in the west moat of Long Valley Caldera 400,000 to 60,000 years ago. Mammoth Mountain was formed during this period. Multiple eruptions from 40,000 to 600 years ago created the Mono Craters and eruptions 5,000 to 500 years ago formed the Inyo Craters. Lava flows 5,000 years ago built the Red Cones, and explosion pits on Mammoth Mountain were excavated in the last 1,000 years. Uplift of Paoha Island in Mono Lake about 250 years ago is the most recent activity. These eruptions most likely originated from small magma bodies rather than from a single, large magma chamber like the one that produced the massive Long Valley Caldera eruption 760,000 years ago. During the past 3,000 years, eruptions have occurred every 250 to 700 years. In 1980, a series of earthquakes and uplift within and south of Long Valley Caldera indicated renewed activity in the area. The region has been used by humans for centuries. Obsidian was collected by Mono Paiutes for making sharp tools and arrow points. Glassy rock continues to be removed in modern times for use as commercial scour and yard decoration. Mono Mills processed timber felled on or near the volcanoes for the nearby boomtown Bodie in the late 19th to early 20th centuries. Water diversions into the Los Angeles Aqueduct system from their natural outlets in Mono Lake started in 1941 after a water tunnel was cut under the Mono Craters. Mono Lake Volcanic Field and a large part of the Mono Craters gained some protection under Mono Basin National Forest Scenic Area in 1984. Resource use along all of the chain is managed by the United States Forest Service as part of Inyo National Forest. Various activities are possible along the chain, including hiking, bird watching, canoeing, skiing, and mountain biking."

Both entities co-operate with the Festival, the first as organizer and the second as sponsor. The first year it was held it was called Certamen Internacional de Cine y TV Infantil (International Children's cinema and TV contest).

From 1977 till 1978 it received the name Certamen Internacional de Cine para la Infancia y la Juventud (International Cinema Contest for Children and Teens). Although in 1986 the Festival began to put the text Gijón International Film Festival in front of its name, it was not until 1988 that it officially adopted this name. Every year the Festival appoints a Young Jury made up of teens between 17–25 years among those, who request it. The present director, Nacho Carballo, was appointed in 2012 to replace José Luis Cienfuegos. On May 1996 the Entidad Mercantil Artístico-Musical Teatro Municipal Jovellanos de Gijón, S.A., body in charge of the organization of the event together with the City Council, was founded. This institution is in charge of the theatre's running, the festivities department and the organization of the Film Festival.

7,38,"Denis-Perron Dam (French: Barrage Denis-Perron) is a rockfill embankment dam spanning the Sainte-Marguerite River, a tributary of the lower Saint Lawrence River, in eastern Quebec, Canada. Standing 171 metres (561 ft) high and 378 metres (1,240 ft) long, the dam is the primary component of Hydro-Québec's Sainte-Marguerite 3 hydroelectric project. The dam is the second highest in Quebec and the hydraulic head afforded to its power plant is also the largest in the province. Construction on the dam began in 1994 after seven years of studies and planning. Before construction began on the dam proper, a 19-metre (62 ft) high, 160-metre (520 ft) long cofferdam was raised to divert the river through a tunnel west of the dam site. An average of 500 workers and a maximum of 1,200, most of whom lived in a construction camp that opened in January 1995, were employed at the dam site during construction. After the cutting of some 233 million board feet of lumber from the future reservoir site, the dam began to impound water in 1998 and finally reached capacity in 2001. The dam and reservoir lie in a very remote region, and an 86-kilometre (53 mi) long access road had to be built to facilitate transportation to the construction site. No area residents were displaced as a result of the remote location, but a large portion of the territory of the indigenous Innu people was flooded. In 1994, Hydro-Québec paid the local Innu CA$20.9 million as compensation. Full project completion was reached in 2002 at a cost of CA$2.4 billion, making it one of the most significant 21st century hydroelectric developments in North America. After the dam was finished, temporary facilities used during construction were dismantled to ease impact on the local environment. The main workers' camp was actually demolished in 2001, a year before the project's final completion. These areas were replanted with some six hundred thousand trees. Hydroelectricity generation began in 2003. As of 2003, the dam was projected to generate about 2.73 TWh of electricity per year, or an average output of just over 310 megawatts (MW). The dam impounds a 140 km (87 mi) long, 253 km2 (63,000-acre) reservoir with a capacity of about 12.5 km3 (10,100,000 acre·ft). Excess water is released through a set of outlet works at the base of the dam, with a capacity of 1,440 m3/s (51,000 cu ft/s), and an emergency spillway about 1 km (0.62 mi) northwest of the dam. The spillway's three gates have a total capacity of 1,875 m3/s (66,200 cu ft/s), and its outflow rejoins the river about 1 km (0.62 mi) below the base of the dam. Water is fed from the reservoir through an 8.3 km (5.2 mi) long penstock to the Sainte-Marguerite 3 generating plant, which is located underground and can produce up to 882 MW from two turbines. Hydro-Québec is in the process of adding a third unit, bringing the total generating capacity to 1,322 MW, scheduled for completion in 2014."

1,48,"The 2015 Madrilenian parliamentary election was held on Sunday, 24 May 2015, to elect the 10th Assembly of Madrid, the unicameral regional legislature of the Spanish autonomous community of Madrid. At stake were all 129 seats in the Assembly. The election was held concurrently with the regional elections for 12 other autonomous communities, as well as the 2015 municipal elections. The ruling People's Party (PPM) emerged once again as the largest political force in the region, but it saw a substantial drop in its vote support and the loss of the absolute majority it had held almost uninterruptedly since 1995 (with a brief interlude in 2003). However, as both the Socialist Party of Madrid (PSM-PSOE) and newcomer Podemos fell one seat short of an absolute majority, it meant that the PPM could command an absolute majority together with Citizens (C's). As a result, a confidence and supply agreement between the PPM and C's elected Cristina Cifuentes as new President of the Community of Madrid. Cifuentes would be the third regional President in three years, after Esperanza Aguirre's resignation in 2012 and incumbent President Ignacio González not running for the office as a result of several scandals. The left-wing United Left (IU) coalition lost its parliamentary representation for the first time in history as a result of not reaching the required 5% threshold, while Union, Progress and Democracy (UPyD), which had entered the regional parliament in 2011 for the first time, was nearly obliberated at the polls.

9,49,"The Northern Ireland Women's Coalition (NIWC) was a minor political party in Northern Ireland. It was founded in 1996 by Catholic academic Monica McWilliams and Protestant social worker Pearl Sagar to contest the elections to the Northern Ireland Forum, the body for all-party talks which led to the Belfast Agreement. The party did not espouse a particular ideology and campaigned principally around the fact that it was led by women rather than men. It declined to take any position on whether Northern Ireland should be part of the United Kingdom or the Republic of Ireland, but strongly opposed sectarian violence from both sides. It attracted support from former supporters of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, but also the Social Democratic and Labour Party and the Ulster Unionist Party. In the 1996 Forum elections, McWilliams, Sagar and eight other Coalition candidates secured 7,731 votes (1.03% of the total) and did not win any constituency seats, but under a 'top-up' mechanism to ensure the representation of minor parties they were awarded two seats as Members of the Northern Ireland Forum, taken by McWilliams and Sagar. They attended the negotiations dominated by the other 108 representatives and supported (but did not, as often reported, sign) the ensuing intergovernmental Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement. The party claimed credit for the inclusion of a commitment to integrated education in the agreement, as did the much larger Alliance Party. In the 1998 Northern Ireland Assembly election, the NIWC secured 13,018 votes (1.6%) and McWilliams, representing South Belfast, and Jane Morrice, representing North Down, were elected to the inaugural Northern Ireland Assembly. The party secured 3,301 votes (0.4%) and one council seat in the Northern Ireland local elections, 2001; McWilliams also stood unsuccessfully as a candidate in the United Kingdom general election, 2001, securing 2,968 votes (0.4% of the Northern Ireland total). Both its MLAs lost their seats in the 2003 Assembly elections, when the party's vote fell to 5,785 (0.8%), and its last remaining elected representative lost her seat on North Down Borough Council in 2005 when the NIWC secured 0.1% of the Northern Ireland vote. The party never contested another election and on 11 May 2006 the Women's Coalition was formally wound up at a function held in Belfast."

It is the seat of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Toledo. The cathedral of Toledo is one of the three 13th-century High Gothic cathedrals in Spain and is considered, in the opinion of some authorities, to be the magnum opus of the Gothic style in Spain. It was begun in 1226 under the rule of Ferdinand III and the last Gothic contributions were made in the 15th century when, in 1493, the vaults of the central nave were finished during the time of the Catholic Monarchs. It was modeled after the Bourges Cathedral, although its five naves plan is a consequence of the constructors' intention to cover all of the sacred space of the former city mosque with the cathedral, and of the former sahn with the cloister. It also combines some characteristics of the Mudéjar style, mainly in the cloister, with the presence of multifoiled arches in the triforium. The spectacular incorporation of light and the structural achievements of the ambulatory vaults are some of its more remarkable aspects. It is built with white limestone from the quarries of Olihuelas, near Toledo. It is popularly known as Dives Toletana (meaning The Rich Toledan in Latin)."

The summit is marked by a nearby sheep shelter and an unusual and conspicuous cairn - taller and more rectangular than most others locally.

There are fine views over to Wild Boar Fell and Swarth Fell 5 km to the west, across the dale of Mallerstang. Hill walkers seem to prefer to give it the name Archy Styrigg; although Ordnance Survey maps show this name along the small plateau at about 680 m elevation to the southwest of the summit, leading over Mallerstang Edge. (This would fit the Norse name, characteristic of this area: sty = track or path, rigg = ridge: i.e. path along a ridge). It is classified as a Nuttall and sub-Hewitt, but it has a relatively small prominence, having several other high points nearby, and hardly merits being described as a peak. This high, boggy ground is really one great plateau which rarely drops much below 600 m (2000 ft) between Mallerstang Edge and Great Shunner Fell, 5.4 km to the south-east.

The River Doon issues from its northern end, while the loch itself receives waters from Loch Enoch (in the Galloway Hills) via Eglin Lane. In the 13th century, it was a site of Balloch Castle, owned by the Earls of Carrick. During the Scottish Wars of Independence it was held by one Gille Brighde, Sir Gilbert de Carrick, a native Carrick nobleman who surrendered it to the English. It was soon recovered by the Scots. In the 15th century, it was frequently in the hands of the Kennedy Clan, although it was briefly in the hands of the Maclellans (backed by William Douglas, 8th Earl of Douglas) after a siege in 1446. The castle was destroyed in the 16th century by King James V as part of a general policy of reducing the power of the barons. The loch was dammed in the 1930s, raising the water some 27 feet, in order to provide seasonal storage for the Galloway hydro-electric power scheme. As a reservoir, Loch Doon has an effective capacity of over 82 million cubic metres. When rainfall is plentiful, water is diverted to the loch from the Water of Deugh via a tunnel system. When water is required for power generation, water is released at Drumjohn to feed Kendoon power reservoir, the first in a series of generating stations and reservoirs on the Water of Ken. During the construction of the scheme, the ruins of the castle were moved from an island in the Loch to the shore to avoid the rising water."

1,26,"Men's single sculls competition at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing was held between August 9 and 16, at the Shunyi Olympic Rowing-Canoeing Park. This rowing event is a single scull event, meaning that each boat is propelled by a single rower. The \""scull\"" portion means that the rower uses two oars, one on each side of the boat; this contrasts with sweep rowing in which each rower has one oar and rows on only one side (not feasible for singles events). The competition consists of multiple rounds. Finals were held to determine the placing of each boat; these finals were given letters with those nearer to the beginning of the alphabet meaning a better ranking. Semifinals were named based on which finals they fed, with each semifinal having two possible finals. During the first round six heats were held. The top four boats in each heat advanced to the quarterfinals, while all others were relegated to the E/F semifinals. The quarterfinals were the second round for rowers still competing for medals. Placing in the quarterfinal heats determined which semifinal the boat would race in. The top three boats in each quarterfinal moved on to the A/B semifinals, with the bottom three boats going to the C/D semifinals. Six semifinals were held, two each of A/B semifinals, C/D semifinals, and E/F semifinals. For each semifinal race, the top three boats moved on to the better of the two finals, while the bottom three boats went to the lesser of the two finals possible. For example, a second-place finish in an A/B semifinal would result in advancement to the A final. The fourth and final round was the Finals. Each final determined a set of rankings. The A final determined the medals, along with the rest of the places through 6th. The B final gave rankings from 7th to 12th, the C from 13th to 18th, and so on. Thus, to win a medal rowers had to finish in the top four of their heat, top three of their quarterfinal, and top three of their A/B semifinal to reach the A final."

In the early 20th century, the SDP commanded some 40% of the vote, but after the Finnish Civil War of 1918, Communists split from the party to form the Communist Party of Finland. After that, the SDP has usually commanded 20–29% of the total votes in those elections that Communists or their fronts have been allowed to contest. There was an uninterrupted 30-year period of social democratic presidents between 1982 and 2012. In the 2007 parliamentary election, SDP received 21.4 percent of the vote and lost 8 seats. In the 2008 municipal elections, the party continued its decline with the largest drop since 1960. In the latest parliamentary election, in 2011, the party received 19.1 percent of the vote and lost another three seats, giving it 42 seats. This was the party's worst result in parliamentary elections in terms of popular support, but in the 2015 election the party sank further still with 16.5 percent of the vote and 34 seats. Despite the fact that the word sosiaali in modern Finnish has a long a, the name of this party is officially spelt in an old-fashioned way with a short a, for historical reasons."

1,37,"The 1975 Haicheng earthquake, hit Haicheng, Liaoning in China at 19:36 CST on February 4. The earthquake registered at 7.3 on the Richter Scale, which is associated with total destruction of infrastructure and property. Haicheng had approximately 1 million residents at the time of the earthquake, which is known for being one of the few earthquakes to be successfully predicted throughout history. Early in the morning of February 4, 1975, Chinese officials ordered that the city of Haicheng be evacuated, believing there to be a large chance of an earthquake occurring. The prediction was allegedly based on reports of changes in groundwater and soil elevations over the past several months as well as widespread accounts of unusual animal behavior. A low-level alert was triggered by regional increases in seismicity (later recognized as foreshocks). Both authorities and citizens were finally placed on high alert and an evacuation order was issued due to an increase in foreshocks. Though this particular prediction of the earthquake was initially believed to be just the latest in a recent string of false alarms that had occurred in the preceding months, including one case of an earthquake swarm being caused by the filling of a reservoir, the evacuation of Haicheng proceeded anyway and eventually paid off. The evacuation, despite successfully evacuating most of Haicheng's population, did not prevent deaths in its entirety. When the main quake struck at 7:36 pm, 2,041 people died, over 27,000 were injured and thousands of buildings collapsed. However, the death toll was much lower than the estimate of over 150,000 dead which is believed to have resulted if the evacuation had not taken place. This was the only successful evacuation of a potentially affected population before a devastating earthquake in history. In addition to damage in Liaoning Province and its surroundings, minor damage was also reported in Seoul, South Korea. The quake was felt in Primorskiy Krai, USSR, and in Kyushu, Japan. In recent years, the success of the earthquake's prediction has come under scrutiny. Seismologists have agreed that the Haicheng earthquake can't be looked to as any sort of \""prototype\"" for predicting future earthquakes, as the foreshocks that played a huge role in leading to prediction of this earthquake are not a regular, reliable occurrence before all earthquakes. However, Qi-Fu Chen, a research professor at Beijing's China Earthquake Administration, explained that this earthquake at least \""showed the importance of public education,\"" prompting a further discussion about the necessity of making the public aware of the dangers, preparations, and warning signs related to earthquakes."

1,48,"The Finnish Civil War (27 January – 15 May 1918) concerned leadership and control of Finland during the transition from a Grand Duchy of the Russian Empire to an independent state. The conflict formed a part of the national, political, and social turmoil caused by World War I (Eastern Front) in Europe. The war was fought between the Reds, led by the Social Democratic Party and the Whites, conducted by the non-socialist, conservative-led senate. The paramilitary Red Guards, composed of industrial and agrarian workers, controlled the cities and industrial centers of southern Finland. The paramilitary White Guards, composed of peasants and middle-class and upper-class factions, controlled rural central and northern Finland. Finnish society had experienced rapid population growth, industrialization, pre-urbanization and the rise of a comprehensive labor movement. The country's political and governmental systems were in an unstable phase of democratization and modernization, while the people's socioeconomic condition and national-cultural status gradually improved. World War I led to the collapse of the Russian Empire and a power struggle, militarization and escalating crisis between the left-leaning Finnish labor movement and the Finnish conservatives. The Reds carried out an unsuccessful general offensive in February 1918, supplied with weapons by Soviet Russia. A counteroffensive by the Whites began in March, reinforced by an Imperial German Army squad in April. The decisive military actions of the war were the Battles of Tampere and Viipuri, won by the Whites, and the Battles of Helsinki and Lahti, won by German troops, leading to overall victory of the Whites and the German forces. Both the Reds and Whites engaged in political terror. A large number of Reds perished due to malnutrition and disease in prison camps. Altogether, around 39,000 people died in the war, including 36,000 Finns - out of a population of 3,000,000. In the aftermath, the Finns passed from Russian government to the German sphere of power. The Finnish conservatives tried to establish a Finnish monarchy, but the plan was aborted by the defeat of Germany in World War I. Finland emerged as an independent, democratic republic. The war divided the nation for many years and remains one of the most emotionally charged events in Finnish history. The society was reunited through social compromises based on a long-term culture of moderate politics and religion, the outcome of World War I and the postwar economic recovery."

7,39,"3367 Alex, provisional designation 1983 CA3, is a metallic asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt, approximately 17 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by American astronomer Norman Thomas at Lowell's Anderson Mesa Station, near Flagstaff, Arizona, on 15 February 1983. The X-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.6–3.0 AU once every 4 years and 8 months (1,697 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.07 an inclination of 5° with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at Heidelberg Observatory in 1953, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 30 years prior to its discovery. In February 2006 and April 2011, two rotational light-curves of this asteroid were obtained from photometric observations made by French astronomers René Roy and Laurent Bernasconi, respectively. The fragmentary light-curves gave an identical rotation period of 9.6 and 9.6±0.5 hours with a respective brightness variation of 0.01 and 0.05 in magnitude (U=1/1). Such a low amplitude typically indicates that the body has a nearly spheroidal shape. According to the space-based surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid has an albedo of 0.10, and measures 17.0 and 15.2 kilometers in diameter, respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 19.3 kilometers. However, preliminary results obtained by NEOWISE are not in line with all other observations. NEOWISE finds a high albedo of 0.30 with a much lower diameter of 9.6. kilometers, and classifies it as a bright E-type asteroid, while CALL and the SMASS taxonomic scheme give it a metallic X-type spectrum. The minor planet was named by the discoverer after his grandson, Alex R. Baltutis. Naming citation was published on 26 March 1986 (M.P.C. 10550)."

He was the son of a certain Toqaq surnamed Temür Yalığ (meaning \""of the iron bow\"") and either the chief or an eminent member from the Kınık tribe of the Oghuz Turks. In 985, the Seljuq clan split off from the bulk of the Tokuz-Oghuz, a confederacy of nine clans long settled between the Aral and Caspian Seas. They set up camp on the right bank of the lower Syr Darya (Jaxartes), in the direction of Jend, near Kzyl Orda in present-day south-central Kazakhstan. There, in 985, Seljuk converted to Islam. The biblical names of his four sons — Mikail (Michael), Isrâîl (Israel), Mûsâ (Moses), and Yûnus (Jonah) — suggest previous acquaintance with either Khazar Judaism or Nestorian Christianity. According to some sources, Seljuk began his career as an officer in the Khazar army. Under Mikâîl's sons Tuğrul and Çağrı, the Seljuqs migrated into Khurasan. Ghaznavid attempts to stop Seljuqs raiding the local Muslim populace led to the Battle of Dandanaqan on 23 May 1040. Victorious Seljuqs became masters of Khurasan, expanding their power into Transoxiana and across Iran. By 1055, Tuğrul had expanded his control all the way to Baghdad, setting himself up as the champion of the Abbasid caliph, who honored him with the title sultan. Earlier rulers may have used this title but the Seljuqs seem to have been the first to inscribe it on their coins."

Born in Mandatory Palestine, Said was an American citizen from birth by way of his father Wadir Saïd, a U.S. Army veteran of the First World War (1914–18). Educated in the Western canon, at British and American schools, Said applied his education and bi-cultural perspective to illuminating the gaps of cultural and political understanding between the Western world and the Eastern world, especially about the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in the Middle East. His main influences were Antonio Gramsci, Michel Foucault, and Theodor Adorno. As a cultural critic, Said is known for the book Orientalism (1978), a critique of the cultural representations that are the bases of Orientalism—how the Western world perceives The Orient. Said’s model of textual analysis transformed the academic discourse of researchers in literary theory, literary criticism, and Middle Eastern studies—how academics examine, describe, and define the cultures being studied. As a seminal work, Orientalism has been a subject of scholarly controversy. As a public intellectual, Said was a controversial member of the Palestinian National Council, because he publicly criticized Israel and the Arab countries, especially the political and cultural policies of Muslim régimes who acted against the national interests of their peoples. Said advocated the establishment of a Palestinian state to ensure equal political and human rights for the Palestinians in Israel, including the right of return to the homeland. He defined his oppositional relation with the status quo as the remit of the public intellectual who has “to sift, to judge, to criticize, to choose, so that choice and agency return to the individual” man and woman. In 1999, with his friend Daniel Barenboim, Said co-founded the West–Eastern Divan Orchestra, based in Seville, which comprises young Israeli, Palestinian, and Arab musicians. Moreover, besides being a Renaissance Man, Said was an accomplished pianist; and, with Barenboim, co-authored the book Parallels and Paradoxes: Explorations in Music and Society (2002), a compilation of their conversations about music. Said died of leukemia in September 2003."

9,47,"Sir William Lamond Allardyce GCMG (14 November 1861 – 10 June 1930) was a career British civil servant in the Colonial Office who served as governor of Fiji (1901–1902), the Falkland Islands (1904–1914), Bahamas (1914–1920), Tasmania (1920–1922), and Newfoundland (1922–1928). Allardyce was born near Bombay, India, the son of Georgina Dickson Abbott and Colonel James Allardyce. Educated in Aberdeen, Scotland and at Oxford Military College, at the age of 18 he joined the British Civil Service in the Colonial Office. His first posting was Fiji where only two years after arriving there he was named acting Resident Commissioner for the island of Rotuma. The following year as magistrate and seven years later he was appointed to the Native Regulation Board and made the commissioner of the Supreme Court. In 1894 he was made Commissioner for Native Lands and given a seat in the Legislative Council. In 1895 he was appointed Native Commissioner, the chief liaison between the Fijian natives and the British. In 1904 Allardyce was appointed as Governor of the Falkland Islands. After 10 years at the Falklands he was then transferred to the Bahamas to become its governor. A post he held for six years. Allardyce then became governor of Tasmania, but retired after only two years—taking the last three months as leave—as a result of his failure to obtain an increase in his salary of £2750. In fact a statement made to the Parliament of Tasmania on his salary and allowances was followed by a vote by the Legislative Assembly to abolish his office, although the same motion was defeated in the Legislative Council. Nevertheless, when he left office he was widely praised for his performance of the office. Allardyce was subsequently ordered to Newfoundland where he was to succeed Sir Charles Alexander Harris as Governor of Newfoundland, where he was invited to become patron of the Great War Veterans Association. He was the official Crown representative of the unveiling of the National War Memorial by Field Marshal the Earl Haig on 1 July 1924. He officiated at the opening of the other national war memorial, Memorial University College, on 15 September 1925. Allardyce as governor was a key promoter in the decision awarding jurisdiction over most of the Labrador Peninsula to Newfoundland by the British Privy Council. In 1916 Allardyce was made Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Michael and St. George by King George V. Some years later he became Knight Grand Cross in 1927. Allardyce married twice, first to Constance Greene of Melbourne, Australia in 1895. She died in 1918; he then in 1920 married Elsie Elizabeth Stewart, widow of A.C. Goodfellow. In 1923, Lady Allardyce helped start the Girl Guide movement in Newfoundland, and then in 1924 she established the Newfoundland Outport Nursing and Industrial Association (NONIA). Allardyce was noted as one of the most competent administrators ever appointed by the Colonial Office to serve as the official representative of the British Crown in Newfoundland and Labrador."

He is a graduate from the University of Tennessee, and was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 11th round of the amateur draft. He made his major league debut in 1996 with the Cards. On April 17, 1997, he recorded his first stolen base with a steal of home against pitcher Kevin Brown who threw a wild pitchout. DiFelice was chosen by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays with the 20th selection of the 1997 MLB Expansion Draft. On July 25, 2001, he was traded with Albie Lopez to the Arizona Diamondbacks for Jason Conti and Nick Bierbrodt. He was released by the Diamondbacks on September 4, and since then has signed as a free agent to play with the St. Louis Cardinals, Kansas City Royals, Detroit Tigers, was sent to the Chicago Cubs as part of a conditional deal, then signed with the Florida Marlins, New York Mets, Washington Nationals, and again with the Mets. Over the first two seasons he spent with the Mets, (2005 and 2006), his batting averages were very bad, in 2005, he had a batting average of .118, (2-17), in 2006 he had only an .080 batting average, (2-25). However, in 2007, his final year with the Mets, his batting average improved to .250, (10-40). Even with that, the Mets still declined to offer salary arbitration to DiFelice. On January 6, 2008, he signed a minor league deal with the Tampa Bay Rays. He saw his last action at the major league level in April of that season, appearing in seven games.

9,49,"The Midland Railway of Canada was a historical Canadian railway which ran from Port Hope, Ontario to Midland on Georgian Bay. The line was originally intended to run to Peterborough, but the competing Cobourg and Peterborough Railway was completed in 1854 and the owner's plans changed. Redirecting the line northward, it opened as the Port Hope, Lindsay & Beaverton Railway, a much longer line than originally planned. A further expansion launched in 1869 pushed the line westward towards Georgian Bay, and prompted renaming as the Midland Railway. By the 1880s the area east of Toronto was over-served by a number of short and generally unprofitable lines. Merger plans between the various lines began in 1881, which resulted in the Midland adding a third rail to the Toronto and Nipissing Railway's (T&N) narrow-gauge line to allow Midland trains to follow the T&N lines into Scarborough. The merger was officially completed in 1881. On 10 March 1882 the company arranged an enormous merger of many of the smaller railways in the area, including the Whitby, Port Perry and Lindsay Railway, Victoria Railway, Toronto and Ottawa Railway and Grand Junction Railway to become a greatly expanded Midland Railway with 474 miles (763 km) of track. Only two years later the Grand Trunk Railway leased most of the lines in the area as part of a major expansion plan, and purchased them outright in 1893. The Midland was one of the earliest examples of a rail trail conversion in Ontario, started as a Canadian Centennial project. Today, the Midland Railway mainline forms a major portion of the Ganaraska Hiking Trail, the majority of which was opened in 1969."

Sonic and his long-time sidekick Tails must team up with Doctor Eggman, normally their enemy, to stop the Deadly Six, leading to conflicts among the three parties. While the gameplay is typical of the Sonic series in some ways, it adds parkour mechanics and features largely cylindrical level design with an emphasis on alternate pathways. The game also features the Wisp creatures from Sonic Colors and Sonic Generations as power-ups. The game began development shortly after the 2010 release of Sonic Colors.

The game received mixed reviews upon release; its controls and the Deadly Six were frequently criticized, but its visuals and audio were seen positively.

7,68,"Chelmsford City racecourse, originally known as Great Leighs Racecourse, is a thoroughbred horse racing venue located in Great Leighs near Chelmsford, Essex, England. In fact the course is much nearer Braintree than Chelmsford. When it opened in April 2008, it was the first entirely new racecourse in the UK since Taunton opened in 1927. It went into administration in January 2009, and racing did not resume until January 2015. Chelmsford City (known as Great Leighs at the time) was developed and owned by entrepreneur John Holmes and his son, Jonathan. It aimed to exploit potentially the largest unserved market in British horseracing. Overall there is slightly more than one racecourse per million people in Great Britain, but there was no racecourse in Essex (population >1.6 million), in east London (formerly in part, part of Essex) or in the neighbouring county of Hertfordshire (population >1 million). The new course is only 50 miles (80 kilometres) from Newmarket, the largest racehorse training centre in Britain. The course is laid out as an 8.5-furlong (1,700-metre) left-handed Polytrack oval, with a 2-furlong (400-metre) home straight. The 10,000-capacity grandstand was used at the 2006 Ryder Cup."

The Hospital was a pioneering initiative, established under the Chairmanship of Late Deshamanya H. K. Dharmadasa, to be a centre of excellence in high technology diagnostic and curative facilities. Driven by the Vision to be the Hospital of Tomorrow, the medical institution has come to be known as a centre of excellence and a preferred healthcare institution in the country.

7,32,"The Peconic Bay is the parent name for two bays between the North Fork and South Fork of Long Island in the U.S. state of New York. It is separated from Gardiners Bay by Shelter Island. Peconic Bay is divided by Robins Island into the Great Peconic Bay on the west and Little Peconic Bay on the east. Great Peconic is a shallow bay, less than 30 feet (9 m), while Little Peconic can have depths over 80 feet (25 m). The west end of Great Peconic Bay is also called Flanders Bay. The Shinnecock Canal provides access from the Great Peconic Bay to Shinnecock Bay. The two Peconic Bays are often collectively referred to as \""the Peconics\"". The Peconics are a tidal estuary system fed at the western end by the Peconic River. Other notable tidal estuary creeks which provide brackish water to the system are Meeting House Creek, Brushes Creek, James Creek, and Deep Hole Creek on the North Fork. These and others bring lesser salinity to the water compared to the Atlantic Ocean. For that reason, the clams, oysters and bay scallops were numerous for generations since they require brackish water and the bountiful phyto and zooplankton which give the system its first tier of life. Reseeding of shellfish in 2005 and 2006 and leasing of the bottom to commercial farmers for clams and oysters have given rise to hope for the ecosystem. The winter flounder fishing usually caught in the spring has all but collapsed, but fluke (summer flounder), bluefish, porgy (scup) and some northern weakfish are to be found, using clams, squid and spearing for bait. Snappers (young spawned bluefish of the year) give youngsters a real thrill in late summer. August is a time of blue claw crabbing and recent catches 2006 and 2007 in the inlets and creeks have been bountiful. A boaters' paradise for its calm waters in summer and fresh sou'westers in late afternoon for sailing has become a popular vacation spot for New Yorkers and East coasters. Peconic Bay gives its name to the proposed Peconic County, New York, which would comprise the eastern portion of existing Suffolk County that surrounds Peconic Bay. While this movement to split Suffolk County along economic lines (the Western portion is more suburban in character, while the Eastern portion is more rural) has a long history, it has not been active since 1998."

Alasdair MacIntyre has written the following about Geuss: No one among contemporary moral and political philosophers writes better essays than Raymond Geuss. His prose is crisp, elegant, and lucid. His arguments are to the point. And, by inviting us to reconsider what we have hitherto taken for granted, he puts in question not just this or that particular philosophical thesis, but some of the larger projects in which we are engaged. Often enough Geuss does this with remarkable economy, provoking us into first making his questions our own and then discovering how difficult it is to answer them."

CatCat performed wearing long coats over quite revealing costumes resembling vintage underwear. The costumes were identical apart from the colour- the blonde sister, Katja, appeared in green, and Virpi, the brunette, in pink. Each of them carried a microphone with a tip was coloured to match their costume. They were accompanied by two black dancers dressed in the early 1990s \""rapper\"" style- they wore identical waistcoats, one in pink and one in green, and performed a dance routine inspired by breakdance, but also containing a lot of waving \""goodbye\"" in the sections when CatCat sang the chorus.

9,5,"Sir John Johnstone, 1st Baronet (died 30 September 1711) was a Scottish Army officer and a politician. He was the oldest son of Sir James Johnstone of Westerhall, a member of the pre-Union Parliament of Scotland. His mother Margaret was the daughter of John Bannatyne of Corehouse in Lanarkshire. He was the older brother of William Johnstone MP. In 1700 Johnstone became a Shire Commissioner for Dumfriesshire, in succession to his father, and was made a baronet. He supported the Court party in the hope of advancing his army career, and as circumstances changed he moved between patrons, including the rivals Annandale and Queensberry. Backing the Duke of Argyll after 1704, Johnstone consistently voted for the Union with England. In 1707, he became one of the 45 Scottish representatives to the first Parliament of Great Britain. However, he did not make any impact at Westminster, and did not stand for Dumfriesshire in the 1708 election. (His brother William took the seat). By 1711, Johnstone had been promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. He died in September that year, and since his two marriages had produced a daughter but no sons, his baronetcy and estates passed to his brother William."

8,57,"Nothomyrmecia, also known as the dinosaur ant or dawn ant, is a rare genus of ants consisting of a single species, Nothomyrmecia macrops. It lives in South Australia, nesting in old-growth mallee woodland and Eucalyptus woodland. The full distribution of Nothomyrmecia has never been assessed, and it is unknown how widespread it really is; its potential range may be wider if it does favour old-growth mallee woodland. Possible threats to its survival include habitat destruction and climate change. Nothomyrmecia is most active when it is cold because workers encounter fewer competitors and predators such as Camponotus and Iridomyrmex, and it also increases hunting success. Thus, the increase of temperature may prevent them from foraging and very few areas would be suitable for the ant to live in. As a result, the IUCN lists the ant as Critically Endangered. A medium-sized ant, Nothomyrmecia measures 9.7–11 mm (0.38–0.43 in). Workers are monomorphic, showing little morphological differentiation among one another. Mature colonies are very small, with only 50 to 100 individuals in each nest. Workers are strictly nocturnal (active mainly at night) and are solitary foragers, collecting arthropod prey and sweet substances such as honeydew from scale insects and other Hemiptera. They rely on their vision to navigate and there is no evidence to suggest that the species use chemicals to communicate when foraging, but they do use chemical alarm signals. A queen ant will mate with one or more males and, during colony foundation, she will hunt for food until the brood have fully developed. Queens are univoltine (i.e. they produce just one generation of ants each year). Two queens may establish a colony together, but only one will remain once the first generation of workers has been reared. Nothomyrmecia was first described by Australian entomologist John S. Clark in 1934 from two specimens of worker ants. These were reportedly collected in 1931 near the Russell Range, inland from Israelite Bay in Western Australia. After its initial discovery, the ant was not seen again for four decades until a group of entomologists rediscovered it in 1977, 1,300 km (810 mi) away from the original reported site. Dubbed as the 'Holy Grail' of myrmecology, the ant was subject to great scientific interest after its rediscovery, attracting scientists from around the world. In Poochera (the rediscovery site), pictures of the ant are stenciled on the streets, and it is perhaps the only town in the world that thrives off ant-based tourism. Some entomologists have suggested a relationship to the Baltic Eocene fossil ant genus Prionomyrmex based on morphological similarities, but this interpretation is not widely accepted by the entomological community. Owing to its body structure, Nothomyrmecia is regarded to be the most primitive ant alive and a 'living fossil', stimulating studies on its morphology, behaviour, ecology, and chromosomes."

9,56,"Eric \""Ric\"" Dalby is a fictional character from the Australian Channel Seven soap opera Home and Away, played by Mark Furze. He appeared in the series from 15 September 2004 until 24 July 2008. Furze was cast into the role after an audition and a screen test impressed producers. Furze said he was attracted to the role because of Ric's characterisation. Ric was initially portrayed as a bully of vulnerable people and held no respect for authority. Through his storylines, Ric transforms into one of the serial's \""good guys\"" but his violent temper remained. Both Furze and interested media noted that Ric getting involved in fights became a dominant feature throughout his tenure. Ric's use of violence has been central to various plots which have led him into trouble. In one Ric faces a murder charge for a crime he did not commit. Ric later becomes embroiled in an illegal bare-knuckle boxing plot which endangers his life. Furze trained and carried out research for the storyline, which certain media outlets compared to the 1999 film Fight Club due to their similar narratives. Ric's backstory has been attributed to forming his persona, in which he was abused by his father, Owen Dalby. Upon moving to Summer Bay, the serial implemented family links when he is revealed to be the grandson of long-standing character Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher). Flynn Saunders (Joel McIlroy) and Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) also give him a home and foster him. Ric maintains various relationships during his time in the series. Early examples include romances with Cassie Turner (Sharni Vinson) and Belle Taylor (Jessica Tovey) and a prominent relationship with his best friend Matilda Hunter (Indiana Evans). Ric has generally received favourable reviews from critics. Jim Schembri of The Age said behaved in an \""honourable manner\"" in his relationship with Matilda. Nick Levine of Digital Spy has praised his physical appearance, while Greg Hassal of The Sydney Morning Herald praised Ric's storylines. Though, Scott Ellis from the publication opined that Ric managed to annoy nearly every regular character featured in Home and Away. For his portrayal of Ric, Furze has been nominated for various accolades, some of which were in the categories of \""Best Actor\"" and \""Most Popular Actor\""."

8,57,"The New World warblers or wood-warblers are a group of small, often colorful, passerine birds which make up the family Parulidae and are restricted to the New World. They are not closely related to Old World warblers or to Australian warblers. Most are arboreal, but some, like the ovenbird and the two waterthrushes, are primarily terrestrial. Most members of this family are insectivores. It is likely that this group originated in northern Central America, where the greatest number of species and diversity between them is found. From there they spread north during the interglacial periods, mainly as migrants, returning to the ancestral region in winter. Two genera, Myioborus and Basileuterus seem to have colonized South America early, perhaps before the two continents were linked, and together constitute most warbler species of that region. The scientific name for the family, Parulidae, originates from the fact that Linnaeus in 1758 named the northern parula as a tit, Parus americanus, and, as taxonomy developed, the genus name was modified first to Parulus and then to Parula. The family name derives from the name for the genus."

One of the first successful black batsmen in the West Indies, St Hill was an enigmatic character who refused to compromise his playing style. Towards the end of his career, his aggression while batting, even when out of form, resulted in his dismissal without scoring many runs."

9,49,"LTV's (Vought) Airtrans was an automated people mover system that operated at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport between 1974 and 2005. The adaptable people mover was utilized for several separate systems: the Airport Train, Employee Train, American Airlines TrAAin and utility service. All systems utilized the same guideways and vehicle base but served different stations to create various routes. After 30 years of service the system's 1970s technology was no longer adequate for the expanding airport's needs, and in 2005 it was replaced by the current Skylink system. While most of the system was auctioned and sold for scrap, some guideways and stations (some of which are still open to the public) remain. Airtrans moved nearly 5 million people in its first year of operation; by the end of its life it had served over 250 million passengers. As the first US installation of a fully automated transit system, Airtrans technology was expected to be deployed in similar mass transit systems around the country. In Japan, the system was licensed by a consortium formed between Niigata Engineering and Sumitomo Corporation for similar deployments there. However, no further systems were constructed. Car #25 was donated to the Frontiers of Flight Museum in Dallas, Texas, and Cars #30 and #82 were donated to North Texas Historic Transportation in Fort Worth, Texas."

9,47,"Secondotto Palaeologus (also Otho or Ottone; died 16 December 1378) was the Margrave of Montferrat from 1372 to his death, the third of the Greek Palaeologan dynasty. His name Secondotto may derive from his being the second Otto to rule Montferrat in his own right, though he would really be Otto III. More probably it is derived from Saint Secundus (San Secondo in Italian), the patron saint of Asti, which his father treated as the capital of the marquisate. The Otto may be in honour of Otto, Duke of Brunswick-Grubenhagen, a close ally of his father. He was born around 1360 as the first son of John II and Isabella of Majorca. In December 1361, as part of a peace deal made between John II and Galeazzo II Visconti, co-lord of Milan, he was betrothed to the latter’s four-year-old daughter Maria. The city of Asti, on which Galeazzo had also had designs, was to count as part of Maria’s dowry, and Montferrat would be allowed to retain control of it. The peace was short-lived, however, as Maria died in the May of the following year. He succeeded as a child of around 12, and ruled originally under the co-regency of his uncle Otto, Duke of Brunswick-Grubenhagen, and Amadeus VI of Savoy. His father’s will had stipulated that he should remain under his uncle’s tutelage until the age of 25; however Otto left for Naples in 1376 to marry Queen Joan I. Weak and inept, Secondotto could not carry the weight of government which devolved on his shoulders with the absence of his uncle. Secondotto thus decided to marry Violante (2 August 1377), the daughter of Galeazzo II Visconti, and widow of Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, and affirm an alliance with that family against the House of Savoy, Piedmont and Achaea. When Otto of Brunswick's brother attacked and seized Asti, Secondotto called in the aid of his father-in-law, who, with a huge force, retook Asti and maintained it under Milanese control. Secondotto realised at that juncture the danger of his Milanese alliance, but by then it was too late. He gathered a force and led it against the Milanese troops and was defeated. Probably out of fear, he retreated to an unknown destination. He died at Langhirano in the vicinity of Parma in obscure circumstances: he may simply have been the loser in a brawl (he was famously ill-tempered and violent), or he may have been assassinated by an agent of the Visconti. His body was carried to Parma and buried before the high altar of the cathedral. When his uncle received news of his death, he returned at once to the margraviate to handle the succession. He placed Secondotto's brother John III on the Montferrat throne. Despite the involvement of Emperor-elect Wenceslaus, the negotiations which Otto opened with Gian Galeazzo over the recovery of Asti were fruitless."

Claims have been made that his autobiography Samurai! includes fictional stories, and that the number of kills specified in that work were increased to promote sales of the book by Martin Caidin. The book was not published in Japan, and differs from his biographies there."

8,57,"The ocellated antbird (Phaenostictus mcleannani) is a species of antbird in the family Thamnophilidae. It is monotypic within the genus Phaenostictus and found in Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. Its natural habitat is the understory of moist lowland forests, foothill forest, and tall secondary growth woodlands. The species is 19 cm long and weighs around 50 g. The eye is surrounded by a large area of bare blue coloured skin. The plumage varies slightly amongst the three subspecies, but overall it has a grey crown, black throat with a buff breast changing into a spotted belly and back. The ocellated antbird feeds primarily on insects and arthropods, sometimes small lizards. Most of its prey is obtained by following trails of army ants, which flush the prey out from hiding places. One such army ant species is Eciton burchellii. The ocellated antbird is considered an obligate follower of army ants, seldom foraging away from swarms. Amongst the species of antbirds and other army ant followers (such as tanagers and woodcreepers) it is usually a dominant species. The social biology of this species is unusual for the antbird family. The breeding pair form the nucleus of a group or clan that includes their male offspring and their mates. These clans work together to defend territories against rivals. The open nest cup was only recently described, with a clutch of two eggs."

Built by the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway (SP&S) and completed in 1908, it was originally a swing-span bridge, and its swing-span section was the longest in the world at the time. However, 81 years later the main span was converted from a swing-type to a vertical-lift type, in order to widen the navigation channel. The lift span is one of the highest and longest in the world. The bridge consists of five sections, with the two sections closest to the bank on each side fixed. The BNSF Railway owns the bridge, and the 5.1 denotes the distance in miles from Portland's Union Station or from the nearby North Bank Depot (or Hoyt Street Depot), which was the Portland terminus of SP&S passenger service coming via this bridge until 1922.

Founding editor Peter Craven was sacked by the magazine's owner, property developer Morry Schwartz, in early 2004 over a dispute about the joint authorship of one essay, and, more widely, the magazine's future direction. Schwartz stated that while he had a vision of the magazine as more \""political and Australian\"" whereas Craven was perhaps \""more broad and internationalist\""."

9,47,"Theodorico César de Sande Pacheco de Sacadura Botte (Quinta da Bica, Portugal, October 31, 1902 - Maputo, Mozambique, November 18, 1987), commonly known as Theodorico de Sacadura Botte, was a Portuguese colonial administrator and entrepreneur. Born into a Portuguese rural aristocratic family, Sacadura Botte left Lisbon and moved to the Portuguese African Overseas in the wave of State takeover of the colonial administration from the British-owned private companies it was formerly commissioned to. After many years as a colonial administrator, and having been Administrator of two different districts, as well as Chief of Cabinet of the Governor of Mozambique, he became an entrepreneur and businessmen, with strong interests in international trade, real estate, horticulture and agriculture. After the fall of the Portuguese authoritarian regime known as Estado Novo, all Portuguese overseas territories in Africa were granted independence. Most of the political factions that took over these new countries were marxist guerilla movements, which started a wave of nationalization of properties and businesses, as well as, in many cases, persecution of Portuguese nationals. Although Sacadura Botte saw most of his property taken or destroyed and most of his family and friends exiled, he remained in Mozambique and acknowledged the new regime, thus earning the respect of the new leaders and of the Mozambican people, who mostly left him in peace. This was also, in all likeliness, fueled by the fact that he was considered a just and kind governor by the people under his rule in both his jurisdictions. In his final years, he wrote a memoir, titled \""Memórias e Autobiografia: 24 anos em Portugal e 60 em Africa\"" (Memoirs and Autobiography: 24 years in Portugal and 60 in Africa), which told his life story and is considered by many to be a great instrument of insight into the final years of the Portuguese Overseas Empire, as well as an interesting account of most of the 20th century through the eyes of a member of the last generation of Portuguese colonialists. Theodorico de Sacadura Botte died in Maputo, the capital of Mozambique, on November 18, 1987, aged 85."

A canon of the diocese and cathedral of Aberdeen, on the translation of William Elphinstone from Bishop of Ross to Bishop of Aberdeen, Hay was provided as Elphinstone's successor in Ross, this occurring on 16 May 1483. He was probably the Thomas Hay who held the Aberdeen prebend of Turriff. It was Bishop Hay who, on 12 September 1487, with the consent of the cathedral chapter of Fortrose and at the request of King James III of Scotland, erected the church of St Duthac at Tain into a collegiate church, \""for the increase of the divine worship of the chapel or collegiate church of the blessed confessor Duthac of Tain\"". The new church consisted of and was to support one provost, two deacons or sub-deacons, a sacrist, an assistant sacrist, and three child choristers; the five prebendary canonries where to be Cambuscurry, Dunskeath, Morangie, Newmore and Tarlogie. The erection was confirmed under the Great Seal of Scotland on 3 December, and was confirmed by Pope Innocent VIII in 1492. Bishop Hay was at parliament on 11 January 1488, his last appearance in any contemporary sources. Hay's episcopate therefore lasted until at least 1488; it did not last beyond early 1492, the latest possible date for the appearance of John Guthrie as his successor; it is unclear if Bishop Hay died, or if he resigned, or if got demoted, though death is the most likely."

7,41,"BeppoSAX was an Italian–Dutch satellite for X-ray astronomy which played a crucial role in resolving the origin of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), the most energetic events known in the universe. It was the first X-ray mission capable of simultaneously observing targets over more than 3 decades of energy, from 0.1 to 300 kiloelectronvolts (keV) with relatively large area, good (for the time) energy resolution and imaging capabilities (with a spatial resolution of 1 arc minute between 0.1 and 10 keV). BeppoSAX was a major programme of the Italian Space Agency (ASI) with the participation of the Netherlands Agency for Aerospace Programmes (NIVR). The prime contractor for the space segment was Alenia while Nuova Telespazio led the development of the ground segment. Most of the scientific instruments were developed by the Italian National Research Council (CNR) while the Wide Field Cameras were developed by the Netherlands Institute for Space Research (SRON) and the LECS was developed by the astrophysics division of the European Space Agency's ESTEC facility. BeppoSAX was named in honour of the Italian physicist Giuseppe \""Beppo\"" Occhialini. SAX stands for \""Satellite per Astronomia a raggi X\"" or \""Satellite for X-ray Astronomy\"". X-ray observations cannot be performed from ground-based telescopes, since Earth's atmosphere blocks most of the incoming radiation. One of BeppoSAX's main achievements was the identification of numerous gamma ray bursts with extra-galactic objects. (See the linked article for details.) Launched by an Atlas-Centaur on 30 April 1996 into a low inclination (<4 degree) low-Earth orbit, the expected operating life of two years was extended to April 30, 2002 due to high scientific interest in the mission and the continued good technical status. After this date, the orbit started to decay rapidly and various subsystems were starting to fail making it no longer worthwhile to conduct scientific observations. On April 29, 2003, the satellite ended its life falling into the Pacific Ocean."

Daunte Culpepper amassed MVP-like statistics, throwing for 4,717 passing yards (leading the NFL), 39 passing touchdowns (a Viking record), and 5,123 total yards (an NFL record). In the wild card matchup, the Vikings defeated the rival Green Bay Packers in their first ever playoff meeting, 31–17, becoming the second team in NFL history to have a .500 record (8–8) in the regular season and win a playoff game (the first team to do it was the St. Louis Rams, who beat Seattle 27–20 the day before the Vikings-Packers game took place). In the divisional round, the Vikings were defeated by the eventual NFC champion Philadelphia Eagles 27–14, ending their season in a game noted for Viking penalties, turnovers, and other miscues. Following the season, Randy Moss was traded to the Oakland Raiders. The Vikings would not make the playoffs again until 2008."

1,48,"The Battle of Festubert (15–25 May 1915) was an attack by the British army in the Artois region of France on the western front during World War I. The offensive formed part of a series of attacks by the French Tenth Army and the British First Army in the Second Battle of Artois (3 May – 18 June 1915). After the failure of the attempted breakthrough by the First Army in the attack at Aubers Ridge (9 May 1915) tactics of a short hurricane bombardment and an infantry advance with unlimited objectives, were replaced by the French practice of slow and deliberate artillery-fire intended to prepare the way for an infantry attack. A continuous three-day bombardment by the British heavy artillery was planned, to cut wire and demolish German machine-gun posts and infantry strong-points. The German defences were to be captured by a continuous attack, by one division from Rue du Bois to Chocolat Menier Corner and by a second division 600 yards (550 m) north, which was to capture the German trenches to the left of Festubert. The objectives were 1,000 yards (910 m) forward, rather than the 3,000 yards (2,700 m) depth of advance intended at Aubers Ridge. The battle was the first British attempt at attrition."

9,16,"The Atlanta Hawks are a professional basketball team based in Atlanta. The Hawks compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member team of the league's Eastern Conference Southeast Division. The team plays its home games at Philips Arena. The team's origins can be traced to the establishment of the Tri-Cities Blackhawks in 1946 in Moline, Illinois, a member of the National Basketball League (NBL) and owned by Ben Kerner & Leo Ferris. In 1949, they joined the NBA as part of the merger between the NBL and the Basketball Association of America (BAA), and had Red Auerbach as coach briefly. In 1951, Kerner moved the team to Milwaukee, where they changed their name to the Hawks. Kerner and the team moved again in 1955 to St. Louis, where they won their only NBA championship in 1958 and qualified to play in the NBA Finals in 1957, 1960 and 1961. The Hawks played the Boston Celtics in all four of their trips to the NBA Finals. The St. Louis Hawks moved to Atlanta in 1968, when Kerner sold the franchise to Thomas Cousins and former Georgia Governor Carl Sanders. The Hawks currently own the second-longest drought (behind the Sacramento Kings) of not winning an NBA championship at 57 seasons. The franchise's lone NBA championship, as well as all four NBA Finals appearances, occurred when the team was based in St. Louis. Meanwhile, they went 48 years without advancing past the second round of the playoffs in any format, until finally breaking through in 2015. Much of the failure they've experienced in the postseason can be traced back to their poor history in the NBA draft. Since 1980, the Hawks have drafted only four players who have been chosen to play in an NBA All-Star Game (Doc Rivers, Kevin Willis, Al Horford, and Jeff Teague). Dominique Wilkins was actually selected by the Utah Jazz and traded to the Hawks a few months after the draft. Horford and Teague are the only All-Star Hawks to have been drafted since Willis was selected in 1984, and Horford is also the only first-rounder the Hawks selected in their nine-year playoff drought to play in an NBA All-Star Game."

8,57,"The corn crake, corncrake or landrail (Crex crex) is a bird in the rail family. It breeds in Europe and Asia as far east as western China, and migrates to Africa for the northern hemisphere's winter. It is a medium-sized crake with buff- or grey-streaked brownish-black upperparts, chestnut markings on the wings, and blue-grey underparts with rust-coloured and white bars on the flanks and undertail. The strong bill is flesh-toned, the iris is pale brown, and the legs and feet are pale grey. Juveniles are similar in plumage to adults, and downy chicks are black, as with all rails. There are no subspecies, although individuals from the east of the breeding range tend to be slightly paler than their western counterparts. The male's call is a loud krek krek, from which the scientific name is derived. The corn crake is larger than its closest relative, the African crake, which shares its wintering range; that species is also darker-plumaged, and has a plainer face. The corn crake's breeding habitat is grassland, particularly hayfields, and it uses similar environments on the wintering grounds. This secretive species builds a nest of grass leaves in a hollow in the ground and lays 6–14 cream-coloured eggs which are covered with rufous blotches. These hatch in 19–20 days, and the black precocial chicks fledge after about five weeks. This crake is in steep decline across much of its former breeding range because modern farming practices often destroy nests before breeding is completed. The corn crake is omnivorous but mainly feeds on invertebrates, the occasional small frog or mammal, and plant material including grass seed and cereal grain. Natural threats include introduced and feral mammals, large birds, various parasites and diseases. Although numbers have declined steeply in western Europe, this bird is classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List because of its huge range and large, apparently stable, populations in Russia and Kazakhstan. Numbers in western China are more significant than previously thought, and conservation measures have facilitated an increased population in some countries which had suffered the greatest losses. Despite its elusive nature, the loud call has ensured the corn crake has been noted in literature, and garnered a range of local and dialect names."

He was born in Westminster, London. Alikhan's cricketing career began in 1986 for Sussex, for whom he made his debut against Cambridge University, and becoming a regular in the first team from the outset of his career. Alikhan made his County Championship debut against Essex, against whom he finished as the second highest scorer in his very first innings, batting from seventh in the order. Alikhan continued this impressive form while moving slowly further up the order, with his second-highest season average coming in his debut season, and seven half-centuries, his first coming against Leicestershire in an innings of 64 not out. He made seven catches in the outfield during this debut season, while Sussex finished fourteenth in the 1986 County Championship table. At the end of 1986 Alikhan moved to Pakistan to play for Pakistan International Airlines, where he debuted in the Patron's Trophy, reaching the quarter final of the Patron's Trophy before playing in the Final of the PACO Cup, which his team won by a ten-run margin. Alikhan moved back to England for the opening of the 1987 season, where he cemented himself as an opening batsman for the team, making three half-centuries during the season and representing Sussex during a Pakistani tour of England. However, Sussex finished dead last in the County Championship table, with just one win during the entire year. While the following seasons would prove poor for the team as a whole, Alikhan continued to go from strength to strength, finishing just short of his first century for the team in 1988, and not managing to reach the magic 100 mark until two seasons later, scoring the only two centuries of his career in his final two matches of the 1990 season, against Middlesex and Essex. By then he had moved from Sussex to Surrey, making the move prior to the 1989 season. Alikhan was not given another chance to hit a century innings, the closest he came being an innings of 96 not out prior to a declaration. While he remained a first-team player during the 1991 season, he played just one County Championship game during 1992, and 1993 was to prove his final season in England, moving back to play with the Pakistan National Shipping Corporation for the 1993 season, where he lasted for two years before giving up the game."

As commissioner, he introduced competitive parity into the NFL to improve the league's commercial viability and promote its popularity, and he helped make the NFL the most financially sound sports enterprise and preeminent sports attraction in the United States (US). He was posthumously inducted into the charter class of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Bell played football at the University of Pennsylvania, where as quarterback, he led his team to an appearance in the 1917 Rose Bowl. After being drafted into the US Army during World War I, he returned to complete his collegiate career at Penn and went on to become an assistant football coach with the Quakers in the 1920s. During the Great Depression, he was an assistant coach for the Temple Owls and a co-founder and co-owner of the Philadelphia Eagles. With the Eagles, Bell led the way in cooperating with the other NFL owners to establish the National Football League Draft in order to afford the weakest teams the first opportunity to sign the best available players. He subsequently became sole proprietor of the Eagles, but the franchise suffered financially. Eventually, he sold the team and bought a share in the Pittsburgh Steelers. During World War II, Bell astutely argued against the league suspending operations until the war's conclusion. After the war, he was elected NFL commissioner and sold his ownership in the Steelers. As commissioner, he implemented a proactive anti-gambling policy, negotiated a merger with the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), and unilaterally crafted the entire league schedule with an emphasis on enhancing the dramatic effect of late-season matches. During the Golden Age of Television, he tailored the game's rules to strengthen its appeal to mass media and enforced a policy of blacking out local broadcasts of home contests to safeguard ticket receipts. Amid criticism from franchise owners and under pressure from Congress, he unilaterally recognized the NFLPA and facilitated in the development of the first pension plan for the players.

4,45,"\""A Brand New Day\"", also known as \""Everybody Rejoice\"", is a song from the 1975 Broadway musical The Wiz written by American R&B singer and songwriter Luther Vandross. (In 1976 Vandross recorded a version of the song for his album Luther, on Cotillion records.) In the play, the song is sung to celebrate because Dorothy has killed Evilene, the tyrannical Wicked Witch of the West. Dorothy, the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and the Scarecrow sing the song with the newly freed Winkies, who were ruled and enslaved by Evilene. It was later featured in the 1978 film version, sung by cast members Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Nipsey Russell, and Ted Ross (credited as The Wiz Stars). Given the all-Black cast of The Wiz, the song's many references to freedom and new possibilities, (especially as sung by African American characters who had just been freed from enslavement) certainly invoked the struggles and history of Blacks in America. In the onscreen version of the song, Nipsey Russell can even be heard exclaiming \""Free at last!\""—a reference to Civil Rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. (His impromptu addition to the song is not heard on the soundtrack album version, instead replaced by sung vocals by Diana Ross.)

4,45,"Melicious is the debut and only solo album by singer Melissa Lefton. On many promotional copies it was simply titled \""Melissa Lefton\"". The album was originally stated to be due for release on August 21, 2001 on Jive Records. It was later said to be due for release in Spring 2002, but was eventually suspended indefinitely. The album was produced by The Matrix. The only copies of the album that exist are full length promotional copies, none of which include the publicized album cover. There are two variations: one is an acetate promo which has a stick-on label and comes in an orange jewel case. The other comes in a cardboard sleeve and features Lefton in a T-shirt with a jolly roger on it. A three song sampler also exists which plays the songs \""My Hit Song,\"" \""Ozone\"" and \""Sugar Daddy\"". Melicious took on topics like pollution, sugar daddies, occultism and murder, with tongue in cheek lyrics. The month before it was due for release, the Seattle Weekly gave a favourable review of the album, as did the Autumn 2001 edition of Elle Girl. MacKenzie Wilson from AllMusic also spoke highly of the album, saying it \""matches the pop sassiness of the Go-Go's and Cyndi Lauper\"". Jimmy Draper from AllMusic gave the album four stars out of five, concluding \""This isn't your typical Top 40 fodder because, thankfully, there isn't anything typical about Lefton's surprisingly enjoyable and energetic debut.\"" Five years after it was cancelled, Stylus Magazine gave the album a positive review and referred to Lefton as \""[T]he queen of shelved teenpop\"". Two songs on this album were commercially released on other albums. \""I Love Life\"" appeared on the soundtrack to The Princess Diaries. Commenting on the soundtrack Heather Phares from AllMusic spoke favourably of the track. \""My Hit Song\"" appeared on the soundtrack to On the Line and also appeared on the compilation album Cool Traxx! 3. Heather Phares said the track was \""sending up and relishing teen pop's plastic sound and mindless appeal\"". The track \""Radio Rainbow\"" appears in the film Halloweentown II: Kalabar's Revenge, though the film did not release an accompanying soundtrack. A promotional short film was created to promote the album. Called Behind the Muse, it was a mockumentary spoofing the Behind the Music program and format. In it, Lefton is depicted as an already-famous musician who rose to fame as a pop star only to succumb to an IV addiction to SunnyD. After a nearly fatal car crash she records a critically panned album titled \""Ouch!\"", and then revitalizes her career as a Las Vegas lounge singer. The humor in the film is decidedly not for young people; for example, regarding her addiction, Lefton states: \""I was making love to sweaty bums just to score a hit of SunnyD, and it didn't feel good on my vagina.\"" The film was promotionally distributed on VHS and MiniDV tapes."

The plot is set in a fictional history of real-world events and follows the centuries-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight for peace with liberty, and the Templars, who desire peace through order. The story is set in Victorian era London and follows twin assassins Jacob and Evie Frye as they navigate the corridors of organized crime, and take back the city from Templar control. The open world design lets players freely roam London. The game is played from a third-person view and its world is navigated on foot or by carriage. The game introduces new traveling systems and refined combat and stealth mechanics. Players control the two lead protagonists—twins Jacob and Evie Frye—throughout the game's story, switching between them both during and outside of missions. Unlike its direct predecessors, Syndicate does not feature any multiplayer gameplay. Assassin's Creed Syndicate received positive reviews. Critics praised the visuals, the likability of the major characters, especially the Frye twins and the antagonist, the interwoven structure of the sidequests and main objectives, creative mission design, as well as the lightheartedness of the game and the entertaining story.

1,48,"Operation \""Summer Rains\"" (Hebrew: מבצע גשמי קיץ‎‎ Mivtza Gishmey Kayitz) refers to the series of battles between Palestinian militants and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) during summer 2006, prompted by Palestinian operations which resulted in the capture of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Large-scale conventional warfare occurred in the Gaza Strip, starting on June 28, 2006. This was the first major ground operation in the Gaza Strip since Israel's unilateral disengagement plan was implemented between August and September 2005. Israel's stated goals in Operation \""Summer Rains\"" were to suppress the firing of Qassam rockets from Gaza into the western Negev, and to secure the release of Corporal Gilad Shalit, who had been captured by the Palestinian militant group Hamas on June 25. The soldier was captured amid a background of violence between the IDF and Palestinian militant groups since the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. According to statistics published by the Israeli government, 757 missiles from Gaza hit Israel between the withdrawal and the end of June 2006. The IDF had responded with artillery fire and air raids. During the operation, the pace of both rocket fire and shelling increased dramatically, and the IDF mounted numerous ground incursions into the Gaza Strip to target militant groups and their infrastructure, including smuggling tunnels in the Philadelphi Corridor. On the first day of the conflict, Israel also bombed the only electrical power plant in the Gaza Strip. At the start of the incursion, Israel said the operation could end if Shalit was released but noted that it had exhausted all the diplomatic means towards this end that it considered tenable. Egypt acted as a mediator over the issue of the officer's release, and on August 15 a senior Hamas official said it would not release Shalit except in exchange for the release of thousands of Palestinian detainees by Israel. Operation \""Summer Rains\"" was followed by Operation \""Autumn Clouds\"", launched on November 1. When \""Autumn Clouds\"" ended on November 26 with an Israeli withdrawal and ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, no deal for the release of Shalit had been reached. The ceasefire broke down completely amid escalating conflict between Hamas and Fatah in 2007."

Their sound incorporates an ever-changing selection of stringed instruments and keyboards, supported by a typical pop backline of guitar, drums, and bass guitar. Briggs and Ouin met during Freshers' week at Oxford; Briggs thought Ouin looked like a member of Teenage Fanclub, a band both of them liked that became a topic of their first conversation.

And it was a very long process, and quite a fun process that I think every band goes through trying to get the right band name. And we had a massive list, pages and pages, and the only thing that they had in common was that they were all slightly coastal or maritime-themed. So we were looking in books about knots and, I dunno, guides to natural history of the seashore. And we tried quite a few out and they all failed, and this [Stornoway] was the only one that stuck, and it was reinforced by the fact that if you see at the BBC weather forecast, Stornoway is up there…so we get this wonderful free promotion every time there’s a weather report.\"""

9,60,"The so-called Byzantine Master of the Crucifix of Pisa was an anonymous Italian painter active in Pisa in the first half of the thirteenth century. His most important painting is a Crucifixion painted on wood panel, dating to sometime around 1230 and currently in the Museo nazionale di San Matteo. The painting is significant in the history of Italian painting for its iconography of the patient, suffering Christ on the cross; although then new, it quickly replaced the older style, depicting Christ triuphant and free from pain, with open eyes and a regal bearing free from sorrow. The painting contains all the canonical elements of this type of representation, already known from Byzantine art and miniatuer painting. Christ's head falls to the left; the eyes are closed, and a small trail of blood escapes from one wound. The four arms of the cross are decorated with smaller scenes, as is traditional: \n* a painting of Christ in triumph with angels at the head \n* depictions of spectators at the arms \n* the suppedaneo at the feet Flanking the body of Christ are other representations of various scenes from the Passion. The body itself is rigid, with little suggestion of movement or life; this is in contrast to the slightly later depictions of the same scene by Giunta Pisano and Cimabue, both of which show the body bending under its own weight."

9,47,"Nang Keo Phimpha (1343–1438), an epithet meaning literally “The Cruel,” was Queen of Lan Xang in 1438, taking the regnal name Samdach Brhat-Anya Sadu Chao Nying Kaeva Bhima Fa Mahadevi. She is also known by her title Maha Devi, and may have been the only reigning female sovereign of the kingdom of Lan Xang. According to some chronicles, she briefly occupied the throne for a few months, before she was deposed and killed at ninety-five years old. Her brief reign was the culmination of a ten-year period of regicide, which she orchestrated through a series of puppet kings. The true identity of the Maha Devi is a matter of dispute both in the chronicles of later periods, and among current scholars. She has variously been described as the eldest daughter, younger sister, principal wife, or step-mother of Samsenthai. Of the few solid clues to her identity, her title as Maha Devi or “Great Goddess,” was reserved for only the senior queen of a ruling monarch. Scholars including Martin Stuart-Fox and Amphay Dore, point out that both her age at the time of execution and title as Maha Devi indicate her true identity to be Keo Lot Fa the Queen Consort of Fa Ngum from Ayutthaya who would have assumed the title of Maha Devi after the death of Queen Keo Kang Nya in 1368, shortly before Fa Ngum was deposed in 1371. Although her identity remains a mystery, the consensus among the royal chronicles remains that she was the de facto ruler during a brutal succession dispute between court factions from the death of Lan Kham Deng to the accession of Chakkaphat Phaen Phaeo."

During his consulship, Plautianus' image was minted on coins along with Severus' second son Publius Septimius Geta. He assisted Severus in administering the empire and became very wealthy and powerful. Severus made him his second in command. In 202, Plautianus married his daughter Publia Fulvia Plautilla to Caracalla (Severus’ first son) in Rome. Plautianus became so powerful that Roman Empress Julia Domna and Caracalla began to be concerned. The marriage between Caracalla and Publia Fulvia Plautilla was not a happy one. In fact, Caracalla loathed both her and her father, threatening to kill them after becoming sole emperor. When Plautianus discovered this, he plotted to overthrow Severus' family. When Plautianus' treachery was discovered, the imperial family summoned him to the palace and ordered his death on 22 January 205.

9,49,"The Liberal Union (Spanish: Unión Liberal) was a political party in Spain in the third quarter of the 19th century. It was founded by Leopoldo O'Donnell in 1858 with the intent of forging a compromise and taking a centrist position between the two forces that had hitherto dominated Spanish politics during the reign of Isabella II. On one side were the forces of conservative liberalism known as the doceañistas, arrayed around the Moderate Party. Among their leading figures were the queen mother Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies and General Ramón María Narváez. On the other were radical liberal exaltados or veinteañistas arrayed around the Progressive Party and the National Militia. Among their leading figures was General Baldomero Espartero. Both parties had fought on the same side in the Carlist Wars, but they had also at times fought against one another, and elements of the Moderate Party leaned toward absolute monarchy themselves. O'Donnell's intent was to bring together the non-absolutist Moderates and the less \""exalted\"" (radical) Progressives and to occupy the political center. He first came forward with this program in September 1854 a few months after the end of the 10-year reign of the Moderates, but did not succeed in forming a party at that time. The Liberal Union was more of a pragmatic party than an ideological one. They wished to preserve the Spanish monarchy but to oppose absolutism; to reform public administration and favor centralized government; to offer a certain degree of a multi-party system, with room for both Moderates and Progressives; and to have a policy of strong public investment. They also intended to reform the law of the press, but this never came to fruition. After the elections to the Cortes 20 September 1858, the Liberal Union had a majority of seats; it maintained power continuously until the Glorious Revolution of 1868 ushered in the Sexenio Democrático. The Liberal Union centered on O'Donnell and the iron hand of his Minister of Governance, José Posada Herrera. Other prominent figures were Francisco Serrano Domínguez, Juan Manuel de Manzanedo, Juan Prim, Manuel Silvela, and Antonio Cánovas del Castillo. These people, like the party's supporters in general, came from a broad, though largely elite, set of backgrounds: nobles, lawyers, entrepreneurs, mearchants, bankers, military officers and government functionaries. To influence public opinion, the Liberal Union had several newspapers: La Época, El Diario Español and La Correspondencia de España."

4,45,"Kuss-Walzer or 'Kiss Waltz' op. 400 is a waltz by Johann Strauss II composed in 1881. The waltz was dedicated to his second wife, Angelika Dittrich. The waltz comprises melodies from Strauss' popular operetta Der lustige Krieg (The Merry War) and is an orchestral treatment of the Act 2 aria 'Nur für Natur' which was a hit when first performed. Eduard Strauss, the composer's brother, first conducted the orchestral piece at the Court Ball in Vienna in 1882. The introduction consists of arresting chords in the key of G major before proceeding discreetly into a quiet yet poignant waltz theme. The Kiss Waltz differs from Strauss' other waltzes in that the first theme recurs very often, and there are only three other waltz sections of which the first theme would be played again after concluding those successive sections. Despite being of such an economical structure, the waltz was well received at its first performance."

5,24,"Cavalier song is a Jacobean and Carolinian genre of song, a later equivalent to Elizabethan lute song. Many of the surviving examples were part of a large scale lavish court entertainment, the Stuart Masque. The genre is not as widely heard as the lute song, partly due to modern sources for the songs, such as large Musica Britannica volumes being impractical for playing and singing from If playing from the original notation the lute or keyboard player needs to be able to perform from unfigured bass. The period has been neglected by musicologists for some years, because when the songs are played through on the piano they lack substance, and their true worth only emerges through a communicative performance. However, some songs such as Henry Lawes's The Lark,William Lawes' Gather ye Rosebuds, various songs by Thomas Brewer and Nicholas Lanier's The Marigold have found their way into singing anthologies.

Jacques Villeneuve won the race despite being stuck in the pitlane for half a minute during his first pitstop, after a wheelnut problem. Two previous leaders retired from the race due to mechanical failures. Michael Schumacher led by over 40 seconds before a wheel bearing failure caused retirement. Mika Häkkinen seemed set for his first win but his engine blew while he was holding off Villeneuve, having made one stop to the Canadian's two. Further back, Alexander Wurz scored his first podium finish in his third Grand Prix, also briefly leading the race during the pitstops. David Coulthard ran 3rd early on, but faded with braking problems. Schumacher's team-mate Eddie Irvine was close behind Villeneuve when both made their second pitstop, but his car failed as he exited the pits. The race was a disaster for Heinz-Harald Frentzen. He stalled on the grid with the race about to begin, forcing the race start to be aborted and having him to start from the back of the grid. Then on the first lap Jos Verstappen crashed into the back of his Williams car at Becketts' corner ending the German's race immediately. Damon Hill finally scored his first points for the Arrows team after a late retirement for Shinji Nakano."

8,57,"The broad skate, Amblyraja badia, is a poorly known species of skate in the family Rajidae. It occurs at depths of 846 to 2,324 metres (2,776 to 7,625 ft), and has been observed via ROV by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute as deep as 3,167 metres (10,390 ft), making it the deepest-occurring skate known. It is sporadically distributed in the Pacific Ocean, from the Gulf of Panama to British Columbia and the Bering Sea, to the \""Tohoku Slope\"" off northern Honshu and the \""Okhotsk Slope\"" off Hokkaido. The species name, badia, comes from the Latin batius meaning \""brown\"", referring to its color. The pectoral fin disc of the broad skate is wider than it is long, with sharply rounded apices. The snout is short and blunt, with several enlarged thornlets at the tip. Its underside is smooth and its dorsal surface is densely covered with prickles. There are 2-3 pairs of distinctive scapular thorns on each shoulder, usually arranged in a triangle, and a row of 24-29 median thorns along the back, flanked by a row of smaller lateral thornlets on the tail. The tail is relatively short and tapering, with two similar-sized dorsal fins and no interdorsal thorn. The very small caudal fin is placed close behind the second dorsal fin. The coloration is chocolate-brown to gray-brown above with scattered darker spots, same below except for the pelvic fin lobes and tail, which are darker. There are whitish areas on the snout, upper abdomen, nostrils, mouth, gill slits, and anal opening. Broad skates feed on cephalopods, crustaceans, and small bony fishes such as rattails. It is presumably oviparous like other skate species. Males mature from 86 to 93 centimetres (34 to 37 in) and grow to at least 95 centimetres (37 in), while females grow to at least 99 centimetres (39 in). The smallest known free-swimming specimens measured 23 centimetres (9.1 in). This species is of no commercial interest, but is occasionally taken as by-catch in deepwater trawls and traps."

Maleny, Mapleton, Montville and Flaxton are the main settlements located on the range. The Stanley River rises from the southern slopes. Baroon Pocket Dam is a reservoir on Obi Obi Creek which drains the north west slopes of the range. Mary Cairncross Reserve marks the site of the first settler's house on the Blackall Range. Curramore Sanctuary, Mapleton Falls National Park and Kondalilla National Park are also located on the range. Numerous lookouts on the range provide excellent views towards the coast. One of the best is located at Howells Knob, a mountain which rises 561 m above sea level. With its spectacular views, natural beauty and an established tourist industry providing accommodation, restaurants, art galleries and specialty shops, the Blackall Range is a popular tourist destination. Rich timber resources in the area attracted timber-cutters in 1860s. The last logging on the range occurred in 1939. The Blackall and Bunya Mountains ranges are the only two locations where the bunya pine species of tree is found naturally. Activities by community groups with the support of the Queensland Government succeeded in recognising the range with iconic status, meaning the area is given greater environmental protection. In mid-2008 iconic status was confirmed, making the Blackall Range the third such declaration in Queensland after Noosa and Port Douglas."

7,23,"Butser Hill is a chalk hill and one of the highest points in Hampshire. It is also the highest point on the chalk ridge of the South Downs and the second highest point in the South Downs National Park after Blackdown in the Western Weald. Although only 271 metres (889 ft) high, it qualifies as one of England's Marilyns. It is located within the borders of the Queen Elizabeth Country Park, situated about three miles south of the historic market town of Petersfield, Hampshire. The name Butser comes from the Old English Bryttes Oran meaning Briht's slope. Oran or Ora is Old English for flat topped hill and/or steep slope. The flat summit is surrounded by a number of spurs. Iron Age ditches and banks divide the spurs from the summit although the purpose of these earthworks is unclear. There are aerial masts on the hill. The hill was purchased by Hampshire County Council in 1966. Prior to the purchase the summit was used for growing wheat but now the only farming activity is grazing. Most of the park, including Butser Hill, is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest and since 1998 as a National Nature Reserve. At 2.312 square kilometres (0.893 sq mi) this is large when compared against other lowland terrestrial SSSIs and is the second largest area of calcareous grassland in Hampshire. Butser Hill SSSI has been proposed by the Government as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC), recognising its importance from a European perspective. This is due to the rich variety of flora and fauna located upon the hill. Butser Hill is in the top twenty Hampshire chalk grassland sites for its rich vascular flora, and is the richest chalk grassland site in Hampshire in terms of its bryophyte (125 species) and lichen (82 species) flora. As well as this, over 30 species of butterfly have been recorded, including populations of Duke of Burgundy and the Silver-spotted Skipper, making the area an important conservation area for many butterfly species. Butser Hill has also hosted entertainment events. Since 2007 it has hosted butserfest and has hosted various country fairs in the past. There is an annual Fell Run called the Butser Hill Challenge that involves running up and down the hill three times."

8,57,"The hermit warbler (Setophaga occidentalis) is a small perching bird. It is a species of New World warbler. Mature hermit warblers normally grow to be 4½ to 5 inches long. Hermit warblers are dark gray in coloration on top, and white below, and their flanks are streaked with black. The wings have two diagonal white wing bars. The majority of the hermit warbler's head is yellow, and males have a dark black throat, while females have much less black on their throat bib and immature birds have no black throat.

They will sometimes winter in south-west California, but they are migratory and will winter in Central America as far south as Panama. Nests are neat and cup-shaped, constructed from stems, grass, twigs, and pine needles positioned near the tip of a branch high in a conifer tree. The female will lay between 3 and 5 eggs, which are white in color and heavily spotted with brown and lilac speckles. Other incubation and nesting habits are mostly unknown. Like most warblers the hermit warbler eats a strict diet of insects and spiders, and can often be found hanging upside-down from the ends of conifer branches, like a chickadee, probing for food."

7,39,"Phobos (systematic designation: Mars I) is the innermost and larger of the two natural satellites of Mars, the other being Deimos. Both moons were discovered in 1877 by American astronomer Asaph Hall. Phobos is a small, irregularly shaped object with a mean radius of 11 km (7 mi), and is seven times more massive than the outer moon, Deimos. Phobos is named after the Greek god, Phobos, a son of Ares (Mars) and Aphrodite (Venus) which was the personification of Horror. The name \""Phobos\"" is pronounced /ˈfoʊbəs/ FOH-bəs or /ˈfoʊbɒs/ FOH-bos, or like the Greek Φόβος. Phobos orbits 6,000 km (3,700 mi) from the Martian surface, closer to its primary body than any other known planetary moon. It is indeed so close that it orbits Mars much faster than Mars rotates, and completes an orbit in just 7 hours and 39 minutes. As a result, from the surface of Mars it appears to rise in the west, move across the sky in 4 hours and 15 minutes or less, and set in the east, twice each Martian day. Phobos is one of the least reflective bodies in the Solar System, with an albedo of just 0.071. Surface temperatures range from about −4 °C (25 °F) on the sunlit side to −112 °C (−170 °F) on the shadowed side. The defining surface feature is the large impact crater, Stickney, which takes up a substantial proportion of the moon's surface. Images and models indicate that Phobos may be a rubble pile held together by a thin crust, and that it is being torn apart by tidal interactions. Phobos gets closer to Mars by about 2 meters every one hundred years, and it is predicted that within 30 to 50 million years it will either collide with the planet, or break up into a planetary ring."

4,45,"Suite No. 1 (or Fantaisie-Tableaux for two pianos), Op. 5, is a composition for two pianos by Sergei Rachmaninoff. Composed in the summer of 1893 at the Lysikofs estate in Lebeden, Kharkov, this suite was initially titled Fantaisie-Tableux since Rachmaninoff intended it, as he explained in a letter to his cousin Sofia Satin, to consist \""of a series of musical pictures.\"" While François-Rene Tranchefort asserts that the music illustrates four extracts of poems (written by Mikhail Lermontov, Lord Byron, Fyodor Tyutchev and Aleksey Khomyakov), Rachmaninoff biographer Max Harrison counters that while the poems \""convey something of the emotional tone of the music,\"" the music itself is not programmatic. This work was first performed on November 30, 1893, by Rachmaninoff and Pavel Pabst in Moscow, and is dedicated to Tchaikovsky. Rachmaninoff composed a second suite in 1901. The four movements are: I. Barcarolle. Allegretto, in G minor.II. La nuit... L'amour... Adagio sostenuto, in D major. (The night...the love...)III. Les Larmes. Largo di molto, in G minor. (The Tears) IV. Pâques. Allegro maestoso, in G minor.

The congregation began worshiping at this site in 1816. The first structure burned down in 1832, and a second sanctuary was constructed the same year. The third (and present) sanctuary was constructed after a fire in 1848 destroyed the previous structure. The name was changed to \""Downtown\"" after First Presbyterian moved out of downtown Nashville in 1955. The present sanctuary was designed by William Strickland, who also designed the Tennessee State Capitol, in the Egyptian Revival style. Exterior design elements include Egyptian style lotus columns and a winged sun disk. Interior Egyptian style elements include stained glass windows, woodwork and perspective renderings of Egyptian scenes on the sanctuary walls. The design was commissioned during an era when archaeological reports from Egypt were being reported in western publications. The twin towers of Downtown Presbyterian Church are reminiscent of the twin towers of St. Stephen's Church in Philadelphia, the city that Strickland lived in before he moved to Nashville. Surviving drawings illustrate that he also designed Second Presbyterian Church in Nashville, which was demolished in 1979. Downtown Presbyterian Church is one of the few examples of Egyptian Revival architecture in the United States, and may be the best surviving ecclesiastical example. William Strickland also designed the second Mikveh-Israel Synagogue in Philadelphia in 1825 with Egyptian Revival elements, but it has not survived. Two other churches in the United States with Egyptian architectural themes have survived are the First Baptist Church of Essex, Connecticut, and the First Presbyterian Church (Sag Harbor), New York, also known as the Whalers' Church.

7,12,"Manganaro's Grosseria Italiana, commonly referred to as Manganaro's, was an Italian market and deli on Ninth Avenue in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. It opened in 1893 and operated for 119 years, helping to introduce the hero sandwich to Americans. The family closed the business and put the property up for sale in 2012. The business was founded in 1893 by Ernest Petrucci as a wine and spirits store, Petrucci's Wines & Brandies, that also sold groceries. Its location at 488 Ninth Avenue near 37th Street was on a stretch of the avenue that remained lined with exotic food stores for decades. After the enactment of Prohibition in the U.S. in 1919, Petrucci's nephew James Manganaro, an immigrant from Naples, took over the store in the 1920s and changed the name; in 1927 he was able to buy the building. Manganaro may have invented the hero sandwich, and played a role in introducing it to Americans. On his death in 1953, Manganaro's passed to his brother Louis and sister Nina Manganaro Dell'Orto and their spouses; in 1955, with a publicity agent's help, they invented the six-foot \""Hero-Boy\"" sandwich, which was successful enough for one of Dell'Orto's four sons to go on the original version of the TV quiz show I've Got a Secret, and for the family to open a sandwich shop next door at 492–494 Ninth Avenue the following year, while continuing to operate a deli and lunch counter in the rear of the grocery store. In 1962 Louis Manganaro retired and two of his four nephews took over the grocery store and the other two the sandwich shop, Manganaro's Hero-Boy, and the businesses were separated. Sal Dell'Orto, who bought out his brother's half ownership of the grocery store, and James Dell'Orto, who bought out his brother's half ownership of the sandwich shop, fell out over rights to the \""Manganaro's Hero-Boy\"" name, trademarked by the sandwich shop in 1969, and advertising for party sandwich telephone hotlines, which led to two separate court cases. The business' neon sign installed in the early 1930s, which became blinking in the 1960s, was turned off in 2000 so that Manganaro's Hero-Boy could not benefit from it. The grocery store was repeatedly found at fault over the hotline and was ordered to pay damages to the sandwich shop, and the financial drain plus waning popularity, some of it due to the declining neighborhood, led to the decision to sell the building and close. This was first announced early in 2011, but the building was withdrawn from the market; the business then closed in late February 2012. Anthony Bourdain featured the store (and its famously brusque service) in an episode of No Reservations in 2009."
8,57,"The mountain brook lamprey or Allegheny brook lamprey (Ichthyomyzon greeleyi) is a lamprey found in parts of the Mississippi river basin, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and in the Cumberland River and Tennessee River. This fish is jawless with a small sucker mouth and a long, eel-like body. It is fairly small, only growing to about 8 inches (20 cm) in length. The mountain brook lamprey is a non-parasitic lamprey, meaning that they do not attach themselves to larger species of fish. The mountain brook lamprey is believed to have evolved from the parasitic Ohio lamprey (I. bdellium) and occurs, often in abundance, within many of the tributaries of the Ohio and Tennessee River systems. All non-parasitic lampreys require two distinctly different habitats that are connected by free flowing (free of dams) stretches of streams. Adults are found in clear brooks with fast flowing water and either sand or gravel bottoms. Juveniles or ammocoetes are found in slow moving water buried in soft substrate of medium to large streams. As previously stated, the Mountain Brook lamprey is non parasitic and does not attach itself to other fish. In the larval stage before metamorphosis, the lampreys feed on detritus and algae, and after they complete metamorphosis, they obtain energy from stored fat reserves. The spawning season for lampreys is from late April to early May."

However, it was clear that the cars had developed considerably over 12 months, so the changes had very little effect on the lap times."

8,57,"The forest cobra (Naja melanoleuca), also called the black cobra and black and white-lipped cobra, is an elapid native to Africa, mostly the central and western parts of the continent. It is the largest true cobra species with a length up to 3.1 meters. Although it prefers lowland forest and moist savanna habitats, this cobra is highly adaptable and can be found in drier climates within its geographical range. It is a very capable swimmer and is often considered to be semi-aquatic. The forest cobra is a generalist in its feeding habits, having a highly varied diet: anything from large insects to small mammals and other reptiles. This species is alert, nervous and is considered to be a very dangerous snake. When cornered or molested, it will assume the typical cobra warning posture by raising its fore body off the ground, spreading a narrow hood and hissing loudly. Bites to humans are less common than for other African cobras due to various factors, though a bite from this species is a life-threatening emergency."

In the final, Fred Newhouse and Maxie Parks appeared to go for the early lead, while Alberto Juantorena was clearly the slowest out of the blocks, almost giving up the stagger to Jan Werner to his inside. Juantorena stretched out his long stride on the backstretch to regain position about equal to the third American Herman Frazier. Coming off the final turn Juantorena had caught the rest of the field and was a step behind Newhouse. Parks and Fons Brijdenbach were about even two more strides back with Frazier just behind them. As Juantorena began to pass Newhouse, Newhouse noticeably struggled, rocking and losing form, then the gold medal. Three metres back, Frazier just edged ahead of Brijdenbach for the bronze medal, as Parks faded."

9,6,"Luigi Amat di San Filippo e Sorso (20 June 1796 - 30 March 1878) was the dean of the College of Cardinals during the last part of the record long reign of Pope Pius IX. The issue of an ancient and noble Catalan Sardinian family, he was the fifth child and fourth son of Giovanni, Marquess of San Filippo, and Eusebia, Baroness of Sorso. He did his early education wholly in Sardinia, which was unusual for someone who was later to become a major curial official in those days, as most curial officials had to come from the Papal States. Between 1815 and 1825, he obtained distinction as a student of both civil and canon law, and became a priest in 1826. From that point on, he rose rapidly, becoming a bishop just one year after his ordination and soon after a nuncio to the Sicilian kingdom (then separate from mainland Italy), and later to Spain. He was expelled when the Papal States broke off diplomatic relations with Spain in 1835, but two years later Pope Gregory XVI elevated him to the rank of cardinal. After his elevation to the cardinalate, Cardinal Amat continued his previous work as a papal legate in various parts of Italy until the late 1840s. He participated in the conclave that elected Pius IX and in 1852 opted for the order of cardinal bishops. He was Vice-Chancellor of the Holy Roman Church from later that year until he died. During most of Pius IX's reign Cardinal Amat held control of the police force in the Papal States: it has come to light that early in Pius's reign he sacked many policemen because of their political sympathies and was involved in many major political incidents as sympathy within the Papal States for a united Italy increased in the early 1860s. However, Cardinal Amat had considerable success whilst in Bologna in cooling sympathy for socialism in a city that was to become renowned for this in later years. In 1876, at the age of eighty, Cardinal Amat became the longest-serving cardinal in the Church, and officiated over the conclave of 1878 that elected Pope Leo XIII. He was already in poor health by this time and as it turned out lived only one month longer than Pope Pius IX."

9,55,"Francis Planté (2 March 1839 – 19 December 1934) was a French pianist famed as one of the first ever recording artists. He was France's most important pianist in the nineteenth century, apart from Chopin. Planté was born in Orthez. He studied piano under Antoine Marmontel, his career beginning at the age of seven in Paris. While there he met and befriended many like-minded musicians who would have a long-lasting effect on his career. These included Franz Liszt, with whom he played arrangements of two of Liszt's symphonic poems (Les Préludes, and Tasso, Lamento e Trionfo) for 2 pianos, Hector Berlioz, Gioachino Rossini, Charles Gounod, Felix Mendelssohn, Sigismond Thalberg and Charles-Marie Widor. It is also known that he himself heard Frédéric Chopin play, and because of this, his recordings - and indeed the one film available of him - are seen as a link to a 'lost world' of piano performance. He toured the concert platforms of Europe after leaving Paris, expanding his reputation for quality of tone and virtuosic, emotional interpretations. The death of his wife in 1908 resulted in him retiring from the stage, except for charity performances and concerts in aid of those wounded in the First World War. He had many pupils, including Alexander Brailowsky. He died in Saint-Avit. Planté is featured in the 1999 DVD The Art of Piano, in which a short excerpt from the film of him playing Chopin's Étude in C, Op. 10 No. 7 can be seen. Francis Planté's style is considered very different from modern-day recording artists. The recordings available suggest a more paced performance with a more prominent accent on each beat and with the notes more pronounced. Recordings that Planté made include: \n*  Chopin: Études Op. 10, Nos. 4, 5 and 7 \n*  Chopin: Études Op. 25, Nos. 1, 2, 9 and 11 \n*  Berlioz: Serenade \n*  Mendelssohn: Scherzo in E, Op. 16, No. 3. \n*  Boccherini: Minuet"

In 1921, it was extended 5 km from Combleux to Orléans. The canal service was terminated in 1954. Though the canal is disused today, it is kept in a good state with its tow path being used as a cycle trail.

4,45,"The discography of Roy Orbison (April 23, 1936 – December 6, 1988), a singer-songwriter who found the most success in the early rock and roll era from 1957 to 1964. He later enjoyed success as a member of the Traveling Wilburys and a brief resurgence in the 1980s. At the height of his popularity, 22 of Orbison's songs placed on the U.S. Billboard Top 40 chart, and six peaked in the Top Five, including two Number Ones. In the U.K., Orbison scored ten Top 10 hits between 1960 and 1966, including three No.1 singles. Born and raised in Texas, Orbison got his start in a rockabilly band in high school. He broke into professional music under Sam Phillips at Sun Records, but found only marginal success there. After a couple years writing for other musicians, Orbison recorded several songs at Monument Records under producer Fred Foster. With Foster, Orbison and his frequent songwriting partners Joe Melson and Bill Dees tailored many of Orbison's songs for his unique voice; his most popular songs were dramatic ballads ending with emotional crescendos that showcased his powerful vocals. After his biggest hit in 1964, \""Oh, Pretty Woman\"", Orbison continued to record, but not until 1987 did he find the success he had once known when his single \""In Dreams\"" was used in David Lynch's film Blue Velvet. The next year, Orbison recorded with the supergroup Traveling Wilburys alongside Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne, and George Harrison. Lynne produced Orbison's final album Mystery Girl, which was released posthumously in February 1989."

It was discovered by Russian astronomer Sergey Belyavsky at the Crimean Simeiz Observatory on 1 October 1926. The S-type asteroid is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.0–2.5 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,216 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.12 and is tilted by 3 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. It has an albedo between 0.2 and 0.3, based on the surveys carried out by IRAS, Akari, and WISE/NEOWISE. Photometric observations made in 2006 at the Oakley Observatory in Terre Haute, Indiana, found a light curve period of 47.9±0.5 hours, with variation in brightness of less than one magnitude. In 2010, observations were made at the Goat Mountain Astronomical Research Station in Rancho Cucamonga, California, gave a period estimate of 47.9 hours, although this may be a half rotation period instead (99.2 hours). The long rotation period makes accurate estimates more difficult to obtain, so further data is needed to reduce the margin of error. It was named Druzhba, the is a Slavic word for friendship and the name of several cities, towns and other localities in Ukraine, Russia, Bulgaria and Kazakhstan.

4,65,"Attack No. 1 (アタックNo.1 Atakku Nanbā Wan) is a Japanese manga series by Chikako Urano. It also became the first televised female sports anime series in the shōjo category. The anime is an adaptation of Chikako Urano's 1968 volleyball manga serialized in Weekly Margaret Magazine under the same name. Chikako was considered one of the founders of shōjo anime. And the series was introduced not only to push the older female manga fan base (as opposed to the significantly younger audience for magical girl series such as Sally, the Witch) into the anime mainstream, but also capitalizes on the boom of the gold medal Japanese women's volleyball team in the 1964 Olympics. The show did stand out in an era dominated by shōnen adventures and sci-fi anime, and was well received in the anime-friendly television markets of France (as \""Les Attaquantes\""), Germany (where it was retitled as \""Mila Superstar\"" where Kozue was renamed to Mila) and Italy, (where it was originally retitled \""Quella Magnifica Dozzina\"" and later \""Mimì e la nazionale di pallavolo\"" with Kozue was renamed to Mimì). The name Mila came from the immensely popular Italian version of 1984's Attacker You!, in which the main character, You Hazuki, was renamed Mila. A direct sequel was also released in manga format called Shin Attack No.1 (New Attack No.1) in 1976, but it was short lived. The sequel was later redrawn between 2004 and 2005 in a new style by Kanon Ozawa."

8,57,"Dermacentor variabilis, also known as the American dog tick or Wood tick, is a species of tick that is known to carry bacteria responsible for several diseases in humans, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia (Francisella tularensis). It is one of the most well-known hard ticks. Diseases are spread when it sucks blood from the host, which could take several days for the host to experience some symptoms. Though D. variabilis may be exposed to Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, these ticks are not competent vectors for the transmission of this disease. The primary vectors for Borrelia burgdorferi are the deer tick Ixodes scapularis in Eastern parts of the United States, Ixodes pacificus in California and Oregon, and Ixodes ricinus in Europe. Dermacentor variabilis may also carry Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the causative agent of HGE (human granulocytic ehrlichiosis), and Ehrlichia chaffeensis, the causative agent of HME (human monocytic ehrlichiosis). Dermacentor ticks may also induce tick paralysis by elaboration of a neurotoxin that induces rapidly progressive flaccid quadriparesis similar to Guillain–Barré syndrome. The neurotoxin prevents presynaptic release of acetylcholine from neuromuscular junctions. The American Dog tick is a rather colorful tick and is commonly found in highly wooded, shrubby, and long grass areas. Tick numbers can be reduced in your own back yard by cutting the grass, which creates a low humidity environment which is undesired by ticks. Pesticides can also be used and are most effective when they are applied to vegetation that has been cut to a short level."

9,47,"Ibn Abī al-ʻIzz was born in the year 1331 CE/731 AH. He came from a family that had been strong supporters of the Hanafi school of jurisprudence. He was originally from Damascus, moved to Egypt and then returned to Damascus. Ibn Abī al-ʻIzz became embroiled in a controversy due to his view that Allah Ta'ala has a direction, his view that Hell is not eternal and his censure of Ibn Aybuk's qaṣĩdah (poem) due to its contents which he held constituted disbelief. Ibn Abī al-ʻIzz was subsequently removed from his position as judge until an individual named al-Nāṣirī raised the issue to the authorities resulting in Ibn Abī al-ʻIzz's position being returned. He remained at his position until his death in Damascus in 1390/792. Al-‘Izz was also allegedly imprisoned for another one of his beliefs that was viewed as egregious and reprehensible, which was the notion that the Prophet Muhammad was not the very best of all of God’s creations, as this belief went against the consensus of all the Muslim scholars, which is an incontrovertible source of Islamic law. Others however have contested the existence of al-‘Izz altogether and have posited that biographical details are recent interpolations or false attributions. Imam Muhammad Zahid al-Kawthari said, \""A commentary was published [on the Al-Aqidah al-Tahawiyyah], authored by an unknown spuriously affiliated with the Hanafi school, but whose handiwork proclaims his ignorance of this discipline and the fact that he is an anthropomorphist who has lost his compass.\"" The late hadith and usul scholar of Damascus, Sayyid Ibrahim al-Ya`qubi, suspected Ibn Abi al-‘Izz of being a pseudonym for Ibn al-Qayyim, given away by the author's systematic abandonment of the Maturidi and Sunni position on not one but several key points in favour of Ibn Taymiyyah's newly pioneered opinions, and the fact that Ibn al-Qayyim was known to be his teacher Ibn Taymiyyah's most vocal, ardent and vociferous supporter. This claim might be given further credence by the reality that both al-‘Izz and Ibn al-Qayyim lived at the same time and the fact that the former's opinions as espoused in his Al-Aqidah al-Tahawiyyah commentary are indistinguishable from that of Ibn al-Qayyim's opinions, which are furthermore known at the time to have been confined to his teacher Ibn Taymiyyah, himself and his small and select circle of students in Damascus."

7,39,"(137924) 2000 BD19 (also written 2000 BD19) is an asteroid with the smallest perihelion of any numbered asteroid (0.092 AU—38% of Mercury's orbital radius). With its high eccentricity, not only does (137924) 2000 BD19 get very close to the Sun, but it also travels relatively far away from it. It has the third largest aphelion of any numbered Aten asteroid and is one of a small group of Aten asteroids that is also a Mars grazer. Its orbital elements indicate that may be an extinct comet. It hasn't been seen displaying cometary activity so far. (137924) 2000 BD19 was discovered by LINEAR in January 2000 and was soon after located by DANEOPS on Palomar plates from February 10, 1997. This allowed a reasonably precise orbit determination, and as a result it was spotted again on February 27, 2001 and January 21, 2002. When it was discovered, it beat 1995 CR's record for both asteroid with the smallest perihelion and for Aten asteroid with the highest eccentricity. It is estimated that (137924) 2000 BD19's surface temperature reaches ~920 K at perihelion, enough to melt lead and zinc, and nearly enough to melt aluminium. (137924) 2000 BD19 is considered a good candidate for measuring the effects of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity because of how close it comes to the Sun."

9,56,"Matthew \""Matt\"" Fielding, Jr. is a fictional character in the American television series Melrose Place, portrayed by Doug Savant. Matt was an openly gay man working as a social worker in Los Angeles. Initially Matt was not the focus of ongoing storylines, a situation that would not substantially change until the series became a serial drama in its second season. Matt Fielding appeared as a regular character from 1992 until 1997, when he was killed off-screen in a car crash. In contrast to the promiscuous sexual behaviour and relationship issues that drove the stories for Melrose's straight characters, Matt's storylines tended to be about subjects like gay bashing and workplace discrimination. Matt occasionally became romantically involved with another man but the character was never shown in any sexual situations. The one planned instance of Matt's kissing another man was edited to remove the kiss, with a reaction shot of another character substituted.

7,39,"1751 Herget, provisional designation 1955 OC, is a stony asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt. It was discovered by the Indiana Asteroid Program at the U.S. Goethe Link Observatory near Brooklyn, Indiana on 27 July 1955. The S-type asteroid is a member of the Gefion family. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.3–3.3 AU once every 4 years and 8 months (1,701 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.18 and is tilted by 8 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. Little is known about the asteroids size, albedo and rotation, despite having a well-observed orbit with the lowest possible uncertainty (i.e. a condition code of 0) and an observation arc that spans over a period of more than 60 years. The minor planet was named in honor of American astronomer Paul Herget (1908–1981), who was director of the Cincinnati Observatory and distinguished service professor in the University of Cincinnati. He was also founder of the Minor Planet Center in 1947, pioneer in the application of high speed computers to astronomical problems, member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, and past president of IAU's Commission 20 (Positions & Motions of Minor Planets, Comets & Satellites)."

9,49,"The Hanover Stadtbahn is a Stadtbahn (light rail) system in the city of Hanover, Lower Saxony, Germany. The Stadtbahn opened on 29 September 1975, gradually replacing the city's tramway network over the course of the following 25 years. Currently, the Hanover Stadtbahn system consists of 12 main lines (Lines 1-11 & 17; along with one night line (Line 10E) and two supplemental lines (Lines 16 & 18)), serving 196 stations (including 19 underground stations, and 119 high-platform stations), and operating on 121 kilometres (75 mi) of route. The system is run by üstra, which was originally an abbreviation for Überlandwerke und Straßenbahnen Hannover AG. As of 2007, it transported 125 million passengers per year. Three types of light rail cars operate on the system, the TW 6000, built from 1974 to 1993, the TW 2000 (the so-called \""Silberpfeil\""), built from 1997 to 1999, and the TW 3000, which is still being built and was first introduced into A line service in 2015. The system is extensively used, especially during trade shows on the Hanover fairground like CeBIT or the Hannover Messe. It makes up for more than 60% of the GVH transport association's total traffic, spanning over four cities and two counties. Hanover Stadtbahn is complemented by DB-owned Hanover S-Bahn, a suburban heavy rail network which links the outlying suburbs and towns, as well as Hanover Airport, to the city centre."
9,13,"Robert \""Bob\"" Bonnett is a former Australian rules footballer who played with the Port Melbourne Football Club in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) in the 1950s and 1960s. A full-forward from the Port Melbourne area, Bonnett attracted the attention of senior recruiters while playing for the Melbourne Sunday Amateur Football League in 1950, with both South Melbourne (VFL) and City (NTFA) interested in securing his services; but in 1951, at the age of 18, he began playing with Port Melbourne in the VFA. In 1951, he was a leading full-forward in the VFA seconds, kicking 112 goals for the season, and he made his senior debut for Port Melbourne in 1952. Over the following twelve years, Bonnett was a prolific goalkicker for Port Melbourne, kicking a then-VFA record of 933 goals through his career, passing the previous mark of 880 goals set by Frank Seymour in the 1930s; as of 2014, he is the third-highest goalkicker in VFA history, behind only Fred Cook and Rino Pretto. He was the VFA's leading goalkicker on four occasions: in 1956 (95 goals), 1957 (97 goals), 1958 (84 goals) and 1961 (a career-best 111 goals); many sources also credit him with a fifth title, in 1963 (44 goals), although contemporary sources suggest he was second behind Yarraville's Robert Evans that year. Bonnett was club captain from 1958 to 1959 and in 1962, won a premiership with the club in 1953, represented the VFA in interstate competition on a number of occasions, and was named in the Port Melbourne Football Club team of the century. He spent his entire senior career with Port Melbourne. Bonnett retired from the seniors at the end of 1963, but continued playing as the captain-coach of the Port Melbourne Seconds team; over the following three seasons, he kicked another 301 goals in the seconds. He coached the Port Melbourne senior team from 1969 until 1971, then returned to coaching the seconds in a non-playing capacity, giving more than thirty continuous years of service to Port Melbourne across his playing and coaching roles. Bonnett was known by the nickname 'Bonox' from his junior days, named after the beef extract product of the same name. Bonnett's younger brother Barry also spent time at full forward at Port Melbourne after Bob's retirement. In 2014, the Williamstown Rd end of North Port Oval was renamed the Bonnett End in honour of Bonnett's goalkicking achievements."

9,60,"Angus McKie (born July 1951) is an artist who has worked as a colorist in the comics industry. He is best known as an English science fiction illustrator whose work appeared on the covers of numerous science fiction paperback novels in the mid-1970s and 1980s, as well as in Stewart Cowley's Terran Trade Authority series of illustrated books. His illustrations often present highly detailed spacecraft against vividly colored backgrounds and high-tech constructions as demonstrated by his pioneering work on The Dome: Ground Zero for DC Comics imprint Helix in 1998. Like Peter Elson, Tony Roberts, Chris Foss and some other artists of the period, he influenced an entire generation of science fiction illustrators and concept artists. This lasting influence is probably visible at its best, about twenty years later, in the visual look developed for the Homeworld videogame. In 1993 he wrote and drew the first 2 parts of a science fiction comic published by Dark Horse entitled \""The Blue Lily\"", based on Dave Weir's short story. As of 2011, McKie was reportedly working on the last 2 parts of the work in his spare time.

4,18,"Razzle is a British soft porn magazine, founded in 1983, published by Paul Raymond Publications. It currently focuses on the girl-next-door style pornography, offering cash for any photos of \""readers' wives\"" printed; in the past, however, several notable glamour models were featured, including minor celebrity Joanne Guest. It also includes the traditional \""true\"" stories. There was an earlier UK men's magazine of the same title that dates from the 1930s to the late 1950s. This was a pocket format title, which featured a colour centre spread by the illustrator George Davies. This men's magazine was later immortalised in the Ian Dury song Razzle In My Pocket (1977, the 'B' side to Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll), a story of a boy trying to steal a copy of said magazine from a bookshop. The song also appears on the 1981 compilation LP Juke Box Dury (side 1, track 6). The name Razzle gains a fair bit of mainstream attention, having been mentioned on numerous British comedy programmes, including Meet Ricky Gervais, Max and Paddy's Road to Nowhere, and in an episode of Absolutely Fabulous where it is implied that Patsy once posed for the magazine (albeit in the early 1970s). It is also mentioned in Men Behaving Badly and Bottom, and in Little Britain, when Lou buys the magazine for Andy. The razzle stack is the way ladies were stacked four high, normally with a pint of Guinness rested to the side. Despite the market for softcore pornography decreasing in the UK, presumably due to a combination of the internet, and more extreme material being available, Razzle is still successful, having launched some spin off titles including Razzle Extreme, The Best of Razzle, Razzle Readers Wives and Razzle DVD. Razzle does however offer hardcore imagery and videos of the photosets found in its magazines online, on the official Paul Raymond website. Razzle is published by Paul Raymond's publishing house, whose other publications include Club International, Escort, Mayfair, Men Only and Men's World. All of the Paul Raymond magazines are widely available in newsagents, although some larger retailers require a modesty bag in order to protect minors from seeing gratuitous flesh on display on the cover. As from 2013, the magazines are also available in digital format exclusively on the Paul Raymond digital newsstand."

7,23,"Blåmannsisen (Lule Sami: Ålmåjalosjiegŋa) is the fifth largest glacier in mainland Norway. It is located on the border of the municipalities of Fauske and Sørfold in Nordland county, Norway—just 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) west of the border with Sweden. Its highest point is 1,560 metres (5,120 ft) above sea level and its lowest point is at an elevation of 810 metres (2,660 ft). Three outlet glaciers extend from the icecap. A small outlet spills over a subglacial ridge to the north damming an unnamed lake resulting in occasion outburst floods. To the east a large outlet extends towards the lake, Leirvatnet. A further outlet descends steeply to the west. The western and northern outlets are heavily crevassed, as is the snout of the eastern glacier calving into Leirvatnet. The glacier also calves into lake Blåmannsisvatnet, resulting in extensive crevasses in the glacier above that lake. Given the degree of crevassing at the margins, traversing the glacier can be dangerous, particularly in late spring or early summer when snow bridges may be weak. Blåmannsisen drains into the local Norwegian hydropower networks operated by Elkem and Saltens Kraftsamband and into the one in Luleälv, Sweden. The ice-dammed lake on the northern margin occasionally produces jökulhlaups (also known as Glacial lake outburst floods). The icecap is typically 200–400 m (660–1,310 ft) thick, exceeding 800 metres (2,600 ft) in places. The equilibrium line altitude (ELA) is around 1,100 metres (3,600 ft) on the eastern side of the icecap, above the Leirvatnet outlet. Satellite imagery, including that used by Google Earth, shows extensive exposed firn suggesting the ELA has retreated in recent years in common with other temperate icecaps in Norway. The southern margin of the glacier exhibits a forefield exposed since the retreat from the 'Little Ice Age' maximum with a well formed end moraine marking a former margin."

Educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham he left school at 16 and spent several years working for an auctioneer before qualifying as a barrister and being called to the Bar in 1894. Despite his lack of a university degree and the business connections that went with it McCardie built up a successful practice in Birmingham and the Midland and Oxford Circuit through a combination of clear arguments, confident advocacy and intense work; he worked so late in his chambers that they became known as \""the lighthouse\"". He moved to London to continue work in 1904 and was a popular barrister, on one day handling twenty-one cases in twenty-one different courts. At the peak of his career he was earning £20,000 while still a junior barrister; a massive amount for that period. He was appointed as a judge of the High Court King's Bench Division in 1916 at the personal recommendation of the Prime Minister H. H. Asquith despite only being a junior barrister (his application to become a King's Counsel in 1910 had been withdrawn), a rarity as most High Court judges were KCs. He became known for two things; firstly the quality and detail of his written judgements, and secondly his tendency to rebel against the judicial norm and criticise the system, which prevented him from advancing further up the judicial hierarchy. He was popular with the Bar and became a bencher of the Middle Temple in 1916 and a reader in 1927, but received much criticism from the judiciary for his judgements. After several bouts of illness and depression while on circuit he committed suicide on 26 April 1933 in his flat. Numerous theories have been advanced as to the cause of the fatal act, and it may be that it resulted from a combination of several causes."

The station was based at Marlborough Boys' College and broadcast on 89FM with the callsign 2STA. This station originally went to air in 1986 and only operated on a part-time basis during school lunch times and some evenings. The station was rebranded as Marlborough's 89FM in 1988 and remained at Marlborough Boys College until 1989 when the station moved to new premises at the Blenheim Post Office Building; by this time the station was broadcasting from 6AM to 12AM.

Since its 1997 expansion the library has consistently ranked highly on the Hennen's American Public Library Ratings (HAPLR) Index. Euclid Public Library was created in 1935 from two branch libraries located in Euclid Central and Shore High Schools. A library Board was appointed. Post war years saw an expansion of Euclid's population, and as each new school was built, EPL established a branch in the school. By 1958 we had 12 branches which pointed out the need for a main library. The library Board was able to save enough money in a building fund to build a library on the present East 222nd Street site at a cost of nearly $300,000. That original building remains part of the library today.Avis Lane was the original library director and served from September 1940 to September 1966. As Euclid's population grew so did library usage, and by 1964 the need for a larger library was apparent. Expansion funds were approved by Euclid voters, and a new addition that tripled the size of the original building was completed in 1966. In 1985 the building was remodeled and updated once again to make better use of existing space. This enabled the addition of space for small discussion groups, preschool story hours, technological advancements, and accessibility for the disabled. Joseph Bana was library director from May 1966 to December 1985. Judith Coleman was library director from January 1986 to March 1989. Dan Siebersma was library director from September 1989 to May 1992. Donna Perdzock was library director from May 1992 to December 2012. In the next ten years library circulation doubled. Audiovisual collections grew from zero to more than 12,000 items. Meeting rooms were filled to capacity. Through a strategic planning process, the community expressed its desire for a technology center, more space for children's and young adult services, a designated area for an African-American collection, better accessibility for the disabled, and more meeting rooms. In 1995 the residents of Euclid recognized these needs by approving a bond issue for construction of an expanded facility to house these services. That facility is now a reality with 48,000 square feet on the original site. Kacie Armstrong has been library director from January 2013 until the present. The library went through a total remodel of the interior to refocus the public space in 2013."

This was the return of the event for the first time since 1928, when officials were concerned about winded athletes following the race and overreacted believing women were not capable of long distance running. This race was the first step in the progression of adding distance events, culminating in the first women's marathon in 1984. Dixie Willis had the best time in qualifying, thus the Olympic record though Lyudmila Shevtsova had set the world record a month earlier in Moscow. In the final Willis took the race out, marked by Shevtsova. By the final straightaway, Brenda Jones was also with Shevtsova and looking fast challenging Willis for the lead. Suddenly Willis stepped on the curb and fell off the track into the infield. Shevtsova edged into the lead and dipped at the finish to equal her own world record and take the gold in 2:04.3. Jones was electronically timed at being .08 behind though electronic timing would not become official for another 17 years.

The game was released in Europe and North America in late 2005, and in Japan and Australia in 2006. The game's sequel, Mario Strikers Charged, was also developed by Next Level Games and is available for the Wii. The game's developers had worked on the NHL series before development of Strikers, which served as an influence for the fast-paced and physical nature of the game. Strikers is a sports game incorporating characters and themes from the Mario franchise. The game features the basic aspects and objectives of a football game, although no referees are present and characters can legitimately shove others out of possession of the ball. As in other games such as Mario Power Tennis, the player can use Mario-themed items such as bananas and red shells to hinder the opposition and gain the advantage. Each team's captain can use \""Super Strikes\"" that, if timed accurately, will result in two points scored for the striker's team. Each team comprises a goal keeper, a main Mario character (captain), and three of the same secondary Mario characters known as \""side kicks\"". The game received \""generally favorable reviews\"" according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. In general, reviewers lauded Strikers' accessibility and multiplayer gameplay, but criticised the lack of gameplay modes and single-player offerings."

8,2,"Hortaea werneckii is a species of yeast in the family Teratosphaeriaceae. It is a black yeast that is investigated for its remarkable halotolerance. While the addition of salt to the medium is not required for its cultivation, H. werneckii can grow in close to saturated NaCl solutions. To emphasize this unusually wide adaptability, and to distinguish H. werneckii from other halotolerant fungi, which have lower maximum salinity limits, some authors describe H. werneckii as \""extremely halotolerant\"". Several salt-tolerance mechanisms of H. werneckii have been studied on molecular level. For example, it is known that its major compatible solutes are glycerol, erythritol, arabitol, and mannitol; melanin accumulation of the cell wall aids in retention of at least glycerol inside of the cell. Several components of the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) signalling pathway (which controls responses to osmotic shock) have been studied in detail and some seem to differ in function compared to their counterparts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Adaptation to high concentrations of salt are also accompanied by changes in membrane lipid composition, mainly by increasing the unsaturation of the phospholipid fatty acids. H. werneckii causes a rare superficial and non-invasive skin infection Tinea nigra. The typical symptoms are non-scaly, smooth, brown-black painless spots on the palms of hands and soles of feet. The growth of H. werneckii in liquid media is often yeast-like, although it can switch to filamentous growth. The mechanism of the switch is not known. The cells appear brown because of melanin production. Whole genome sequencing of H. werneckii revealed a recent whole genome duplication, resulting in a relatively large genome (51.6 Mb) with 23333 predicted genes. Genes encoding metal cation transporters, which are thought to play a role in halotolerance, experienced several additional gene duplications at various points during their evolution. A heterothallic mating locus was found in the genome."

8,2,"Lecanicillium longisporum is the approved name of an entomopathogenic fungus species, that was previously widely known as Verticillium lecanii (Zimmerman) Viegas, but is now understood to be an anamorphic form in the Cordyceps group of genera in the Cordycipitaceae. It now appears that isolates formerly classified as V. lecanii could be L. attenuatum, L. lecanii, L. longisporum, L. muscarium or L. nodulosum. \""V. lecanii\"" was first described in 1861 and has a worldwide distribution. Insects are infected when they come into contact with the sticky fungal spores which then grow and invade the body, thus the internal organs are consumed, leading to their death. In horticulture and agriculture Lecanicillium Isolates were first developed by scientists at the Glasshouse Crops Research Institute (now Warwick HRI: formerly part of Horticulture Research International). L. longisporum is now marketed as 'Vertalec', for management of aphid pests, by Koppert in the Netherlands (who provide good illustrations of the fungus)."
7,23,"Ben Lomond, just north of Ogden, Utah, is a peak in the northern portion of the Wasatch Mountains. A popular trail passes over its summit (elevation 9,716 feet (2,961 m)), accessible from four different trailheads to the north, south, and east. It is often referred to by locals as Ben Lomond Peak, Mt. Ben Lomond, and Ben Lomond Mountain. The USGS has it labeled as Ben Lomond on maps. Ben Lomond stands out along the Wasatch Front because the mountain range appears to run east and west along the Wasatch Range, while most mountains appear to run south and north. Two miles northwest of Ben Lomond is Willard Peak, with an elevation of 9,764 feet (2,976 m). Northwest of Willard Peak is Inspiration Point. A dirt road travels 14 miles (23 km) from Mantua, Utah to Inspiration Point. The road is usually not passable until July due to deep snow that resists melting due to the area's northern exposure. Atop Inspiration Point on a clear day, one can see Salt Lake City to the south, Willard Bay and the Great Salt Lake to the west, and the city of Logan, Utah to the northeast. From Inspiration Peak one can hike or bike to the summit of Ben Lomond, and then continue east to a trailhead on North Ogden Pass. The trail is listed as one of the top mountain bike rides in Utah. The distance from the North Ogden trailhead to the summit of Ben Lomond is approximately 9 miles (14 km). Ben Lomond was named after the mountain Ben Lomond in the Scottish Highlands. Mary Wilson Montgomery an early settler thought the mountain range resembled the Munro. According to some sources, the Paramount Pictures logo, known as Majestic Mountain, was modeled after Ben Lomond. It is said that William W. Hodkinson, the founder of Paramount and a native of the Ogden area, initially drew the image on a napkin during a meeting in 1914."

8,57,"The penpoint gunnel (Apodichthys flavidus) is a gunnel, a species of fish from the Pacific coast of North America, ranging from Kodiak Island in the Gulf of Alaska to Santa Barbara Island in southern California. The penpoint gunnel varies in shades of green, maroon, or brown. It is commonly 4–8 in (10–20 cm) long, though it can be up to 1.5 ft (46 cm). It most easily distinguished by the dark bar below each eye, as it is commonly found peeking out of a kelp bed or crevice. There is a row of dark and/or pale spots along the midbody and commonly a series of short, pale bar-like marking extending down from the top of the dorsal fin. The first spine of the anal fin is large and grooved like a fountain pen point. It has a continuous dorsal, tail and anal fins, but no ventral fins. The tail is defined by slightly longer rays. The anal fin is about half the length of the dorsal fin. The penpoint gunnel is mainly found in intertidal areas at depths of 0–6 ft (0.0–1.8 m). It can sometimes be seen in tide pools, also in eelgrass beds, sea lettuce beds, and in stands of kelp. It commonly takes on the color of the vegetation it inhabits. If there is no vegetation (in winter, for example), it can also inhabit rocky areas, lurking under rocks and in protective crevices. However, it can also remain out of the water under rocks or seaweeds. The penpoint gunnel can breathe air when out of water. Penpoint gunnels feed on small crustaceans and mollusks. Pairs are found coiled around egg masses."

Becker, the son of German immigrants, graduated from Harvard University and St. Louis Law School. After 15 years of private law practice, he was elected to a twelve-year term on the St. Louis Court of Appeals in 1916. He was re-elected for second 12-year term in 1928. In 1941 Becker was the Republican Party nominee for Mayor of St. Louis. He defeated incumbent Mayor Bernard F. Dickmann (a Democrat) who was seeking election to a third term in the April 1941 election. Perhaps the most significant development during Becker's term as mayor was the adoption of a civil service amendment to the City Charter. The amendment enacted a merit system for the hiring of city employees. Prior to that time, a political patronage system prevailed in which all city employees could be replaced with a change of partisan administration. Becker supported the civil service reform and it was approved by the voters in September 1941. Becker also retained Raymond Tucker who had been appointed Smoke Commissioner by Mayor Dickmann, and supported his efforts to reduce air pollution within the city. On the Sunday afternoon of August 1, 1943, St. Louis aircraft manufacturer William B. Robertson was hosting the first public demonstration of a new Waco CG-4 glider, built under sub-contract by his company. As a crowd of spectators watched at the Lambert St. Louis Airport, Mayor Becker, Robertson, and other St. Louis luminaries boarded the glider that was towed along by a transport plane for a flight over the city. Immediately after the release of the towing cable, the right wing of the glider broke off, and it plummeted from an altitude of 1,500 feet, killing all ten persons on board. Becker was buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery. Aloys P. Kaufmann, president of the city's Board of Aldermen, succeeded Becker as Mayor of St. Louis."

He is the icon whose brains can be picked for anything on earth. The current editor of the magazine is Sumita Dasgupta. \""Gobar\"" is the Hindi and Nepali word for cow dung.\"" It was chosen to capture the eco-philosophy and tradition of generating wealth from waste. Waste gobar serves as an insecticide and is used to plaster mud houses and is a waterproof coating for walls. It is also used to plaster floors to keep them cool. Gobar is the energy source for rural India. It is used as cooking fuel where people have no access to fuels like LPG.

Elections for the lower house of the Thai National Assembly, the House of Representatives, were held on 2 April 2006 and elections for the upper house, the Senate, were held on 19 April 2006. The Constitutional Court later invalidated the House of Representatives election results and ordered a new round of voting. The ruling Thais Love Thais (TRT) party of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra won a majority seats in the House of Representatives, partly as a result of the decision by the major opposition parties to boycott the elections. Nearly complete results showed that TRT won 61% of the valid vote and about 460 of the 500 seats. Despite this, Thaksin announced his resignation two days after the election. Although TRT easily won the election in terms of both votes and seats, the results were seen by Thaksin's opponents and media critics as a rejection of his call for an overwhelming mandate. In parts of Bangkok and in southern Thailand, most TRT candidates were elected on minority votes after the majority of voters used the \""abstain\"" option on their ballot papers. In a number of southern seats TRT candidates failed to poll the required 20% of registered voters, rendering these southern seats invalid and resulting in party dissolution charges against Thai Rak Thai and Democrat Parties. TRT won all the seats in the Northern and North-Eastern (Isan) regions, and also in the Central region apart from Bangkok. Due to the election result, King Bhumibol Adulyadej took the unprecedented step of calling the elections undemocratic, and soon later the election was declared invalid by the Constitutional Court.

7,28,"The Kennetcook River is a river that flows through Hants County, Nova Scotia. From headwaters near the mouth of the Shubenacadie River, the Kennetcook traverses about 45 kilometres of mostly rural terrain, discharging into the Avon River at Windsor. The Kennetcook cuts through fossiliferous limestone rocks for part of its length. A tidal river near its mouth, the Kennetcook experiences a tidal bore which may be seen at Scotch Village. It is a known salmon river popular with anglers. The village of Kennetcook takes its name from the river, which is a Mi'kmaq word meaning \""the place ahead\"". It was known to the Acadians as Quenetcou. A covered bridge over the river in Kennetcook was the last in Nova Scotia. It was replaced in 1967.

7,9,"The Fairfax Bridge (formerly known as the O'Farrell Bridge) is a steel-lattice three-hinged arch bridge spanning the Carbon River on State Route 165 in Pierce County, Washington. Previous to the construction of the bridge in 1921, the only route south to the area around Fairfax was by train. At a total cost of $80,000, the bridge's deck sits 250 feet (76 m) above the river. The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.In 1921, a riveted steel arch was built jointly by the County and State across the Carbon River providing the link which enabled the construction of the first road to Fairfax. Previously a train, which passed through Fairfax only twice a day, was the town's primary route to the outside world. The only other alternative to was walking to Melmont where there was a wagon road to other towns. The construction of the steel arch which was purported to be the highest span in the state at the time of its construction, was a vital transportation link to this remote town. The 494 feet (151 m) bridge has a 240 feet (73 m) three-hinged braced rib steel arch, two 14 feet (4.3 m) steel towers, and 16 timber trestle approach spans. The chords of the ribs are composed of channels. They are braced with two angles that are latticed in a Warren truss configuration. The vertical members of the towers and spandrel columns are madder up of two latticed channels. The 17.4 feet (5.3 m) wide roadway rests on a Warren stiffening truss. The Minneapolis Steel and Machinery Company provided the steel for the project. The arches sit on concrete footings. The approaches and the deck were reconstructed in 1945.The Fairfax Bridge is one of two three-hinged lattice arches remaining within the State. In his book Bridge Engineering, J.A.L. Waddell explains the reason for the paucity of arches in the United States. \""Arches are employed very generally in Europe on account of their superior appearance as compared with simple-truss bridges, and because of the powerful influence of the old masonry arch upon the minds of European bridge designers, regardless of the consideration of economy. American engineers, on the other hand, have been indifferent to the question of aesthetics, and have preferred simple spans to arches mainly for reasons of simplicity and economy, but sometimes on account of their greater rigidity. Another reason why the arch has not been used much in American practice is that the conditions, which make it economical, are not met with as frequently in this country as in Europe. For deep gorges with rocky sides, or for shallow streams with rock bottom and natural abutments, arches are eminently proper and economical.\"" The conditions that made the bridge type economical in Europe were mirrored in the deep canyon of the Carbon River."

9,34,"John Samuel Potts (12 August 1861 – 28 April 1938) was a Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom who served a Member of Parliament (MP) for twelve years between 1922 and 1938. Born in Bolton, Lancashire, Potts had started work at Durham Colliery at the age of eleven. He was a checkweighman at the Hemsworth Colliery, Yorkshire, for 25 years. At the Barnsley by-election of 1897 Potts supported the Liberal Party-candidate Joseph Walton. While chairing a Liberal election meeting during this by-election, Potts said in the presence of Walton that he would favour a labour party at a time when state payment of MPs, and of official election expenses would enable working men to be maintained in Parliament. But until then, \""the Liberal party was the working man’s only hope\"". In 1905, Potts switched sides, and started working with the Independent Labour Party against Walton, and the leadership of the Yorkshire Miners' Association (YMA). Ten years later Potts was elected as treasurer of the YMA, and became a member of the executive committee of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain. He kept these positions until he was elected as MP for Barnsley at the 1922 general election, when payment of MPs and election expenses had been enacted. Potts held the seat at three further elections in the 1920s. When Labour split at the 1931 general election over Ramsay MacDonald's formation of a National Government, he narrowly lost his seat to the National Liberal candidate Richard John Soper.

In May 1922, oil baron and stable owner Joshua Cosden purchased Chick Lang's contract for a record US$25,000. The seventeen-year-old Lang finished 1922 with 186 wins, just one win behind Mark Fator who won the U.S. riding title with 187. The final day of 1922 fell on a Sunday and Lang, who had a two-win lead, did not race while Fator won three races at Agua Caliente Racetrack in Tijuana, Mexico."

8,57,"The Forbes’s plover or Forbes’s banded plover (Charadrius forbesi) is a small wader. This plover is resident in much of west Africa, mainly on inland rivers, pools and lakes. Its nest is a scrape lined with small pebbles in rocky uplands. After breeding in the wet season, this bird moves to open grasslands, including airfields and golf courses, in the dry season. It is sometimes seen at pools or reservoirs. The adult Forbes’ plover is 20 cm in length. It has long wings and a long tail, and therefore looks different from most other small plovers in flight, the exception being the closely related three-banded plover which replaces it in eastern and southern Africa and Madagascar. The breeding adult has dark brown upperparts, and the underparts are white except for the two black breast bands, separated by a white band, which give this species its common and scientific names. The head is strikingly patterned, with a black crown, brown forehead, white supercilia extending from above the eyes to meet on the back of the neck, and a grey face. The eye ring and the base of the otherwise black bill are red. The sexes are similar. In non-breeding adults, the breast bands may be dark brown, and the supercilia buff-tinged. Juveniles resemble the non-breeding adult, but are duller. This species is larger and darker than the three-banded plover. The latter species also has a white forehead and a white wingbar. Forbes’s plover is often seen as single individuals, but may form small flocks. It hunts by sight for insects, worms and other invertebrates. It has a piping peee-oo call. This species was named for the British zoologist William Alexander Forbes."

9,60,"The Master of the Imhoff Altar (fl. c. 1410-1420) was a German painter. His name comes from an altarpiece, dating to between 1418 and 1422, commissioned by Konrad Imhoff for the Lorenzkirche in Nuremberg. Only the central panel, depicting the Coronation of the Virgin, and the wings, depicting several apostles, are still preserved in the church, albeit partially disassembled. On the inner wings, flanking the Coronation, may be found a donor portrait of the donor with three of his four wives. Originally the back of the altarpiece held an image of Christ as the Man of Sorrows, with the Virgin Mary and Saint John. This piece, which has since been removed to the Germanisches Nationalmuseum, is now believed to be the work of the Master of the Bamberg Altar. It is believed by some historians that the Master of the Imhoff Altar is also the so-called Master of the Deichsler Altarpiece, whose work is known from two surviving altarpiece wings in Berlin. Attempts have been made to link both artists to Berthold Landauer, but these have been based entirely on his activity in Nuremberg at the time in question. The Deischler paintings are believed to predate the Imhoff Altar by five to ten years, and are the work of an artist deeply familiar with the art of Bohemia from around 1400. The Imhoff Altar, by contrast, represents a marked shift towards a firmer and sparer manner, coupled with the use of stronger colors."

9,40,"Geneva Reformed Seminary is a small theological school in Greenville, South Carolina accredited by the Association of Reformed Theological Seminaries and supported by the Free Presbyterian Church of North America. The seminary offers a B.D. and an M.Div. Initially called Whitefield College of the Bible after a companion school in Banbridge, Northern Ireland, the seminary was renamed in 2002 to avoid confusion in the United States where Bible schools and seminaries prepare students at different academic levels. Faith Free Presbyterian Church of Greenville, South Carolina, the first constituted congregation of the Free Presbyterian Church in the United States (1977), had had from its inception a vision of becoming the progenitor of other Free Presbyterian churches in North America. In 1982, Alan Cairns, an Ulsterman and the first pastor of the Greenville church, was commissioned by the Free Presbyterian Church to become the first professor of the new theological school, with teachers from Northern Ireland assisting on an adjunct basis. Training was limited to men preparing for the ministry of the Free Presbyterian Church. Both the Church and its seminary acknowledge the Westminster Confession of Faith and its exposition of Reformed theology, which they believe to be taught by the Bible. Nevertheless, they modify the Westminster Standards by permitting liberty of conscience regarding baptism and eschatology. In an advertising brochure published in 2008, the seminary declared its intent \""to avoid the lamentable abuses\"" of covenant theology by pursuing \""a strongly fervent evangelistic mission....[a] biblical, fundamental, separatist, evangelistic, and Reformed ministry.\"" Ian Paisley, the former moderator of the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, had had a long-standing relationship with Bob Jones University, also located in Greenville, and by February 2007, every GRS faculty member was both a graduate of Bob Jones University and a minister or licentiate minister of the Free Presbyterian Church. In 2001 the Presbytery Commission appointed Michael Barrett, who had earned a Ph.D. in theology from BJU, as president. Admission to the seminary was thereafter opened to members of other denominations. In May 2008, the presbytery approved a certificate program for laypersons, some evening classes, and the introduction of online courses, and by the fall of 2010, eighteen courses were available for online credit or audit. GRS therefore represents a  Calvinistic branch of separatist  fundamentalism in the United States, in contradistinction to Greenville Presbyterian Theological Seminary, another conservative Presbyterian institution just a few miles away."

1,48,"The Siege of Syracuse in 877–78 led to the fall of the city of Syracuse, the Roman and Byzantine capital of Sicily, to the Aghlabids. The siege lasted from August 877 to 21 May 878, when the city, effectively left without assistance by the central Byzantine government, was sacked by the Aghlabid forces. Following their first landing in Sicily in the late 820s, the Aghlabids had tried several times, without success, to capture Syracuse. They were able to gradually take over the western half of the island, however, and in 875, a new and energetic governor, Ja'far ibn Muhammad, was appointed, determined to capture the city. Ja'far began the siege in August 877, but soon left it in charge of his son Abu Ishaq, while he retired to Palermo. The Arabs were well supplied with siege weapons, while the inhabitants of Syracuse were left largely unsupported by the Byzantine fleet, which was busy with transporting marble for a new church in Constantinople, and was then delayed by adverse weather. Consequently, the besieged populace faced great hardships and famine, described in detail by the eyewitness account of Theodosios the Monk. Finally, the Aghlabids managed to effect a breach in the seaward walls, and on 21 May 878 managed to break through it into the city. The defenders and much of the populace were massacred, while others, including Theodosios, were taken prisoner. The Byzantine patrikios who commanded the defence surrendered with a few of his men, but they were executed after a week, while a handful of soldiers escaped and brought the news east to the fleet that had belatedly set sail to aid the city. The Muslims were unable to capitalize upon this success due to internal rivalries, which even led to a full-scale civil war. Small-scale warfare with the Byzantines continued without any side gaining a decisive advantage until the arrival of the deposed Aghlabid emir Ibrahim II, who in 902 rallied the Sicilian Muslims and captured Taormina. This event effectively completed the Muslim conquest of Sicily, although a few fortresses remained in Byzantine hands until 965."

He was the second son of the founder and first king of the dynasty, King Taejo of Joseon. Born in 1357 as Yi Bang-Gwa, he was a prudent, generous, brave, and able military officer. During the latter days of the declining Goryeo Dynasty, Jeongjong followed his father, Yi Seonggye, to various battlefronts and fought at his side. When his father became king in 1392, he became prince. King Taejo had two wives—the first one, who gave birth to six of the king's sons including Jeongjong, died before King Taejo was crowned. Taejo had second wife, who had 2 sons from him. The king favored his youngest son, whose mother was Taejo's second wife. Prime Minister Jeong Dojeon also backed him as the successor to the throne, causing much disappointment from other princes. In 1398, King Taejo's fifth son, Yi Bang-won, who later would be King Taejong of Joseon, led a coup along with many military officers and killed his two brothers, Prime Minister Jeong, and many of his faction. Yi Bang-won first tried to show that he was not intended to take the throne, so he gave a push to his older brother Jeongjong (who was also the oldest then), to be a crown prince. King Taejo was upset and abdicated in disgust, and Jeongjong became king in the following year, 1399. The same year he moved the capital back to Gaegyeong, the old Goryeo capital. In 1400, a conflict broke out between Yi Bang-won and his older brother, Yi Bang-gan. Yi Bang-won's force attacked and defeated that of Bang-gan's, Bang-gan was then sent into exile along with his family. General Bak Bo, who persuaded Bang-gan to fight against Bangwon, was executed.

3,4,"Taylor v. Beckham, 178 U.S. 548 (1900), was a case heard before the Supreme Court of the United States on April 30 and May 1, 1900, to decide the outcome of the disputed Kentucky gubernatorial election of 1899. The litigants were Republican gubernatorial candidate William S. Taylor and Democratic lieutenant gubernatorial candidate J. C. W. Beckham. In the November 7, 1899, election, Taylor received 193,714 votes to Democrat William Goebel's 191,331. This result was certified by a 2–1 decision of the state's Board of Elections. Goebel challenged the election results on the basis of alleged voting irregularities, and the Democrat-controlled Kentucky General Assembly formed a committee to investigate Goebel's claims. Goebel was shot on January 30, 1900, one day before the General Assembly approved the committee's report declaring enough Taylor votes invalid to swing the election to Goebel. As he lay dying of his wounds, Goebel was sworn into office on January 31, 1900. He died on February 3, 1900, and Beckham ascended to the governorship. Claiming the General Assembly's decision was invalid, Taylor sued to prevent Beckham from exercising the authority of the governor's office. Beckham countersued Taylor for possession of the state capitol and governor's mansion. The suits were consolidated and heard in Jefferson County circuit court, which claimed it had no authority to interfere with the method of deciding contested elections prescribed by the state constitution, an outcome that favored Beckham. The Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld the circuit court's decision on appeal and rejected Taylor's claim that he had been deprived of property without due process by stating that an elective office was not property and thus not protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. The injection of Taylor's claim under the Fourteenth Amendment gave him grounds to appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. In a majority opinion delivered by Chief Justice Melville Fuller, the Supreme Court also rejected Taylor's claim to loss of property without due process and thus refused to intervene on Taylor's behalf, claiming that no federal issues were in question and the court lacked jurisdiction. Justices Gray, White, Shiras, and Peckham concurred with the majority opinion. Justice Joseph McKenna concurred with the decision to dismiss, but expressed reservations about the determination that an elected office was not property. Justice David J. Brewer, joined by Justice Henry B. Brown, contended that the Supreme Court did have jurisdiction, but concurred with the result in favor of Beckham. Kentuckian John Marshall Harlan authored the lone dissent from the majority opinion, claiming that the court did have jurisdiction and should have found in favor of Taylor based on his claim of loss of property without due process. He further argued that elective office fell under the definition of \""liberty\"" as used in the Fourteenth Amendment and was protected by due process."

She is also very jealous of the worship of other female loas, as she considers herself able to provide for anything a person could request. In Roman Catholicism, she is syncretized with Saint Anne and her altars are often decorated with pictures and statues of Saint Anne and the child Mary. She is said to work very well with Belie Belcan, another popular loa who is associated with Saint Michael the Archangel. Therefore, one will always find icons of Saint Anne next to icons of Saint Michael in Vodou households and temples. Her feast day is celebrated on 26 July and her favorite colors are yellow and pink. Some people consider Cachita to be one of her \""puntos\"" (or incarnations)."

7,39,"NGC 3593 is a lenticular galaxy located in the constellation Leo. It has a morphological classification of SA(s)0/a, which indicates it is a lenticular galaxy of the pure spiral type. This is a starburst galaxy, which means it is forming new stars at a high rate. This is occurring in a band of gas surrounding the central nucleus. There is a single arm, which spirals outward from this ring. It is frequently but not consistently identified as a member of the Leo Triplet group. This galaxy is known to contain two counter-rotating populations of stars. That is, one set of stars is rotating in the opposite direction with respect to the other. One means for this to occur is by acquiring gas from an external source, which then undergoes star formation. An alternative is by a merger with a second galaxy. Neither scenario has been ruled out. The age of the lower mass, counter-rotating population is younger by about 1.6 ± 0.8 Gyr than the primary star population of the galaxy."

9,49,"The Confederation of Mexican Workers (Spanish:  Confederación de Trabajadores de México (CTM)) is the largest confederation of labor unions in Mexico. For many years, it was one of the essential pillars of the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI), which ruled Mexico for more than seventy years. However, the CTM began to lose influence within the PRI structure in the late 1980s, as technocrats increasingly held power within the party. Eventually, the union found itself forced to deal with a new party in power after the PRI lost the 2000 general election, an event that drastically reduced the CTM's influence in Mexican politics. Over the years the CTM has also lost much of its power within the workplace, increasingly being more agreeable to employers' moves aimed to increase productivity. Workers have usually received little benefit from these agreements, as real wages have generally fallen over the past several decades. Moreover, the CTM has become increasingly corrupt and conservative over the years, often serving to impede workers' efforts to organize independent unions."

Omar Bongo was promoted to key positions as a young official under Gabon's first President Léon M'ba in the 1960s, before being elected Vice-President in his own right in 1966. In 1967, he succeeded M'ba to become the second Gabon President, upon the latter's death. Bongo headed the single-party regime of the Gabonese Democratic Party (PDG) until 1990, when, faced with public pressure, he was forced to introduce multi-party politics into Gabon. His political survival despite intense opposition to his rule in the early 1990s seemed to stem once again from consolidating power by bringing most of the major opposition leaders at the time to his side. The 1993 presidential election was extremely controversial but ended with his re-election then and the subsequent elections of 1998 and 2005. His respective parliamentary majorities increased and the opposition becoming more subdued with each succeeding election. After Cuban President Fidel Castro stepped down in February 2008, Bongo became the world's longest-serving non-monarch ruler. He was one of the longest serving rulers in history. Bongo was criticized for in effect having worked for himself, his family and local elites and not for Gabon and its people. For instance, French green politician Eva Joly claimed that during Bongo's long reign, despite an oil-led GDP per capita growth to one of the highest levels in Africa, Gabon built only 5 km of freeway a year and still had one of the world's highest infant mortality rates by the time of his death in 2009.

The highest hill is Mount Beerwah at 556 meters above sea level, but the most identifiable of all the hills is Mount Tibrogargan which from some directions appears to be a face staring out to sea. Mt Ngungun is a sub volcanic mountain. This means Mount Ngungun is a sub volcanic rock also known as a Hypabyssal Rock. It is an intrusive rock that is emplaced at medium to shallow depths within the crust, and has intermediate grain size and often Porphyritic texture between that of Volcanic and Plutonic rocks. Mount Ngungun and the Glass House Mountains are located near Beerburrum State Forest and Old Gympie Road. From Brisbane, follow the Bruce Highway north, take the Glass House Mountains tourist drive turn-off and follow the signs to the Glass House Mountains. The trip is about one hour and eleven minutes from Brisbane. The Volcanic peaks of the Glass House Mountains rise dramatically from the surrounding Sunshine Coast landscape. They were formed by intrusive plugs, remnants of volcanic activity that occurred 25-27 million years ago. Molten rock filled small vents or intruded as bodies beneath the surface and solidified into land rocks. Millions of years of erosion have removed the surrounding exteriors of volcanic cores and softer sandstone rocks. Whilst the traditional names for the hills themselves are very old, the term 'Glasshouse Mountains' was given more recently by explorer Captain James Cook on 17 May 1770. The peaks reminded him of the glass furnaces in his home county of Yorkshire. Matthew Flinders explored the area and climbed Mount Beerburrum after sailing along Pumicestone Passage in 1799. The Glass House Mountains National Landscape was added to the Australian National Heritage List on 3 August 2006. In the land between the peaks, pineapple and poultry farming, as well as commercial forestry and quarrying are the main land uses."

At the close of voting, it had received 115 points, placing it 3rd in a field of 19. \""Era\"" was a modest hit in Italy, peaking at #13 on the singles chart.

This small passerine bird is strongly migratory, wintering in Africa just south of the Sahara, Arabia and India. Unlike many typical warblers, the sexes are almost identical. This is a small species with a grey back, whitish underparts, a grey head with a darker \""bandit mask\"" through the eyes and a white throat. It is slightly smaller than the whitethroat, and lacks the chestnut wings and uniform head-face color of that species. The lesser whitethroat's song is a fast and rattling sequence of tet or che calls, quite different from the whitethroat's scolding song. Like most \""warblers\"", it is insectivorous, but will also take berries and other soft fruit. This is a bird of fairly open country and cultivation, with large bushes for nesting and some trees. The nest is built in low shrub or brambles, and 3–7 eggs are laid."

A fierce opponent, Tzachas constructed the first Turkish navy and captured a few Aegean islands, supplemented by the conquest of Smyrna and Abydos. In the aftermath of the First Crusade Alexios I launched a counter-attack which regained the territories lost. Alexios was also able to rapidly quell the threat of Abu'l Qasim, the Seljuk governor of Nicaea, who attempted to create a fleet of his own at Abydos in ca. 1090. Tzachas recovered from his first defeat and retook several islands, but was definitively defeated at Lesbos by Constantine Dalassenos and John Doukas in 1092. His capital, Smyrna, and most of the Aegean coastline were recovered by Doukas in 1097, ending the Turks' direct access to the Aegean. Alexios I Komnenos' son, John II Komnenos inherited a sizable amount of land in Western Asia Minor, although the port city of Antalya was under Seljuq siege. Nonetheless, John's tireless campaigns drove the Turks deep into Anatolia and by 1143 the Seljuk Turks had lost all control of the coastal regions of Asia Minor. The Byzantines under Manuel I Komnenos could muster some 200 ships. Not until the demise of the Comnenian dynasty would the Turks capture a port and it was Umur of Aydin in c. 14th century that constituted the first Turkish threat to Christian shipping in the Aegean since the 11th century."

Hardey was the son of Ann (née Robinson) and Joseph Hardey, who had arrived in the Swan River Colony in February 1830. His parents, originally from Lincolnshire, England, were devout Methodists, with his father being the leader of the first Methodist congregation in Perth (as a lay preacher rather than an ordained minister). Hardey was sent to England to be educated, only returning to Australia in 1866. He took over his father's property, Peninsula Farm, and also purchased an estate near York (an inland town). In 1876, Hardey was nominated to the Legislative Council by the governor, Sir William Robinson. He contested a by-election for the seat of York in February 1880, but was defeated by Edward Hamersley, and resigned from parliament in July of the same year. With the advent of responsible government in 1890, the Legislative Council was made fully appointive. Hardey was nominated to the council for a second time, again by Sir William Robinson. He held his seat until 1894, when a constitutional amendment made the council fully elective for the first time. At the 1894 elections, Hardey polled the third-highest number of votes in East Province (behind Charles Dempster and Richard Goldsmith Burges), and was consequently elected to a two-year term. He was defeated by John Taylor in 1896. Outside of parliament, Hardey had been elected to the Perth Road Board in 1877, and was appointed chairman in 1890.

9,6,"Zenaida and Philonella were sisters, born into a well-educated Jewish family and said to be cousins of Paul the Apostle. They were instructed and baptized into the Christian faith by their brother Jason, who was bishop of their native city of Tarsus. On entering the philosophical academy at Tarsus, they devoted themselves to the study of medicine, and when they completed their studies moved to the mountains around Pelion near Demetriada in Thessaly. This was a region renowned for its healing springs and shrines to Asclepius. The physicians who practiced there catered to the wealthy, charging exorbitant amounts for their services, and augmented their incomes with the sale of magical amulets and charms. The sisters set themselves in opposition to the prevailing custom. On locating a cave with a mineral spring, they set up a chapel and cells for themselves, and opened a clinic where they treated all who came to them regardless of their ability to pay. Philonella devoted herself to experimental medicine, using methods approaching that of modern scientific methods, and worked hard to separate effective medicine from superstition. Zenaida was particularly interested in pediatrics. Toward the end of her life she paid particular attention to the treatment of psychiatric disorders, including clinical depression. Both sisters devoted their lives to prayer when they were not working in their clinic. Traditions vary about their deaths. According to one account, the two were stoned to death by pagans on the same night. According to another, both met peaceful ends, with Philonella surviving her sister by some years, deepening her spiritual devotion and becoming known as a wonderworker. They are commemorated on October 11. The name of Zenaida is derived from the Greek: Ζηναις, Zenais, \""of Zeus\"". Her becoming a Christian in general and a venerated saintin particular assured this name's continued use in Christian countries, its Pagan origin forgotten."

7,39,"1647 Menelaus, provisional designation 1957 MK, is a carbonaceous asteroid, about 44 kilometers in diameter. It is a Jupiter Trojan that shares the orbit of the gas giant Jupiter. It was discovered by American astronomer Seth Nicholson at Mount Wilson Observatory northeast of Los Angeles, California, on 23 June 1957. The C-type Trojan asteroid orbits in the so-called Greek Camp – the L4 Lagrangian point of the Sun–Jupiter system. It therefore orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.1–5.3 AU once every 11 years and 11 months (4,352 days). Its orbit also shows a low eccentricity of 0.02 that is tilted by 6 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. It has a rotation period of 17.7 hours and an assumed albedo of 0.057. The Trojan asteroid was named after the Greek mythological figure, Menelaus, husband of Helen of Troy, brother of Agamemnon, and king and leader of the Spartan contingent of the Greek army during the Trojan War. The name was selected by the discoverer to enable another of the famous Greek heroes to join the majority of his compatriots in the camp to the east of Jupiter. The Dictionary of Minor Planet Names also mentions that the lunar crater Menelaus was named after the Greek hero. However, based on the official International Astronomical Union–WGPSN nomenclature, it is named after Greek geometer and astronomer Menelaus of Alexandria (70–140)."

7,39,"HD 210277 b is an extrasolar planet orbiting the star HD 210277. It was discovered in September 1998 by the California and Carnegie Planet Search team using the highly successful radial velocity method. The planet is at least 24% more massive than Jupiter. The mean distance of the planet from the star is slightly more than Earth's distance from the Sun. However, the orbit is very eccentric, so at periastron this distance is almost halved, and at apastron it is as distant as Mars is from the Sun. In 2000, a group of scientists proposed, based on preliminary data from the Hipparcos astrometrical satellite, that the planet would have an inclination of 175.8° and a true mass of 18 times Jupiter making it a brown dwarf instead of a planet. However these measurements were later proved useful only for upper limits of inclination. If the planet orbits in the same plane as the claimed circumstellar disk, which seems a plausible assumption, it would have an inclination of 40° and an absolute mass of 2.2 times Jupiter, however later observations failed to confirm the disk's existence."

9,13,"Gregory Marc Smith (born 20 April 1983) is a former South African cricketer. He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-fast bowler who formerly played for Essex. He had previously played for Derbyshire for eight years. Smith was born in Johannesburg. His international cricketing career began when he played in the Under-19 World Cup competition of 2002 for South Africa, debuting with a steady bowling performance against Bangladesh in a convincing victory for his side. South Africa were to make it to the final of the competition, in which Smith scored a half-century from the number one batting position, though it was not enough to see his team win the match, as this was countered by a century by New South Wales' Under-19 Australian representative Jarrad Burke. Smith made his first appearance in first-class cricket in October 2003, playing for Griqualand West in the 2003–04 SuperSport series, in which the team finished in second place in the league. Smith would make one half-century during 2003–04, against Boland, and left the team in the summer of 2004. Desperate for a County Championship place at a burgeoning team, Smith joined Derbyshire and made his debut Second XI Championship appearance in the same period, in July 2004. However, having scored a duck, he was not to appear again for the side until the 2005 season, where he played in both the Second XI Championship and Trophy. Smith made his debut in the County Championship in the 2006 season, scoring steadily with the bat from the middle order and even trying his hand at bowling during the second innings. As Derbyshire finished mid-table during 2006, Smith stepped in for more appearances for the side, and looked promising for the team's future. In 2008, Smith scored the 20th century in the history of the Twenty20 Cup with a 62-ball innings against Yorkshire Carnegie on 12 June 2008. He ended on exactly 100 not out, in a winning performance for Derbyshire. This, as well as other strong performances, led to him being awarded a new contract which will keep him at Derbyshire for a further two years. He has completed his residency period and is looking to qualify as an English player, following a similar path to that of Kevin Pietersen, for example, but in the meantime plays as a Kolpak player. During the 2011 season, it was announced that he would leave Derbyshire at the end of the season, and in September 2011, he was signed by Essex on a two-year deal, up to the end of the 2013 season. Although continuing with the club after his initial contract ended, he was one of four players released by Essex at the end of the 2015 season. In February 2016 he announced his retirement from first class cricket, having taken a job as Director of Cricket Development and Head Coach for Penzance Cricket Club."

He married Heather Huntingdon on 30 June 1986, just months after they met when she crashed into his car. Heather was a young attractive career lady and it seemed strange that she would fall for the dull-looking middle aged divorcee Nicholas. As with the later character, John Harrison, the writers attempted to make the character more interesting by giving him a flaw. In this case, Nicholas and his best friend Charlie, were heroin addicts. Nicholas lied to Heather about his addiction and despite Barry Grant's warnings, Heather ignored this until it was too late. Nicholas overdosed on heroin and his ex-wife advised Heather to leave him. Heather stayed with him, however it wasn't long before he was stealing from her to fund his habit. In November 1986 Heather finally told him to leave. Four days later he was found dead on a park bench."

It is the shortest regular service in the system, running about 3,000 feet (910 m) in under two minutes. The 42nd Street Shuttle is part of the A Division of New York City Transit, and the tracks that it uses opened in 1904 as part of the first subway in the city. In order to distinguish it from the other shuttles in the system, NYCT Rapid Transit Operations internally refers to it as the 0 (zero).

7,32,"Ogston Reservoir is a reservoir operated by Severn Trent Water in Derbyshire. It is near the villages of Brackenfield, Ashover and Clay Cross. The reservoir takes its water from the River Amber and was originally created to supply the National Coal Board's Carbonisation Plant at Wingerworth; the reservoir now supplies water for the local area and is used as a holding ground for water for nearby Carsington Reservoir. The reservoir covers 200 acres (800,000 m2) and holds 1.3 billion imperial gallons (5.9 billion litres) of water. The valley was flooded in 1958 and completely submerged farmland, roads and part of the Ashover Light Railway. The reservoir also destroyed most of the village of Woolley, including the Woolley House Hydro, the village store, the blacksmiths, the joiners, the laundry, the sheep-dip and 'Napoleons Home', the local public house. The villagers were relocated into council houses built in another local hamlet, Badger Lane, which eventually became known as the village of Woolley on the Moor, which subsequently became the present village of Woolley Moor. The reservoir provides many leisure activities including sailing, windsurfing and trout-fishing. It is especially well known for its bird-life and over 200 species have been recorded at Ogston including Wilson's phalarope, Sabine's gull and long-tailed skuas. Ellen MacArthur, best known as a solo long-distance yachtswoman who, on February 7, 2005, broke the world record for the fastest solo circumnavigation of the globe, trained to become a yachtswoman on Ogston Reservoir.

9,13,"James Sellar (born 24 March 1989 in Adelaide) is an Australian rules footballer who played with Adelaide and Melbourne in the Australian Football League (AFL). Sellar was selected in the 2006 AFL Draft by the Adelaide Football Club at No. 14 overall, considered a bargain pick at the time considering he was touted as a potential top-5 pick. Sellar was educated at Brighton Secondary School along with other AFL draftees Bryce Gibbs and Mark Austin. At 196 cm and weighing 95 kg, Sellar is a key position forward who can also help out with some ruck duties. Sellar represented Australia in the International Rules Youth Test between Australia and Ireland, and has also represented Australia in volleyball, in the Under-19 Internationals in Taiwan. He was named best player at the national Under 16 Championships in 2005 and also played in the Under 18 national championships in 2006. He spent most of his early AFL career playing for Glenelg in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL), playing only a handful of games for the Crows despite being named as an emergency on numerous occasions. With injuries to Brad Moran and Jonathon Griffin in mid-2009, Sellar found his way at last into the regular side in the unlikely role of a backup ruckman to Ivan Maric. He scored his first goal in AFL football against Carlton in the last round of the 2009 season. He however struggled in the 2010 season, only playing four games, averaging a mere 6.5 disposals per game. Sellar was delisted by Adelaide at the end of the 2011 AFL season. In the 2011 AFL Draft, Sellar was selected 54th overall by the Melbourne Demons. He played 23 games in two seasons at Melbourne before he was delisted again at the end of the 2013 AFL season. In 2014, he moved to Western Australia to play for South Fremantle in the West Australian Football League (WAFL)."
7,23,"The Oquirrh Mountains /ˈoʊkər/ is a mountain range that runs north-south for approximately 30 miles (50 km) to form the west side of Utah's Salt Lake Valley, separating it from Tooele Valley. The range runs from northwest Utah County–central, east Tooele County, and ends north at the south shore of the Great Salt Lake. The highest elevation is Flat Top Mountain (Utah) at 10,620 ft (3,237 m). The name Oquirrh was taken from the Goshute word meaning \""wood sitting.\"" The Oquirrh Mountains have been mined for gold, silver, lead, and most famously for copper, as home of the porphyry copper deposit at Bingham Canyon Mine, one of the world's largest open pit mines. As seen from Salt Lake City, the view of the mountain range is dominated by the displaced rock material (known as overburden) dug from the Kennecott mine. At the north end of the range is Kennecott's smelter complex which refines ore concentrates from the mine into useful metals. Dark colored tailings from past metal refining at the complex can be observed from the adjacent freeway, I-80. The value of the minerals taken from the range has been estimated to far exceed the combined value of those taken in the California, Nevada, and Klondike gold and silver rushes. In the winter months, the mountains become home to a small population of bald eagles, which can often be found in the cliffs on the west side of the range down to the reservoir near the town of Stockton. The range has many canyons and dense forests, consisting mainly of conifers and aspen. The area is also home to thriving populations of butterflies, deer, mountain lions, and squirrels. Two of the most popular canyons are Yellow Fork Canyon and Butterfield Canyon. Yellow Fork Canyon is home to a trail administered by Salt Lake County and numerous gated communities. Butterfield Canyon contains a paved road (with the exception of a 1/4 mile portion on the Tooele side that is well maintained dirt) that connects Tooele with Herriman. Butterfield Canyon road climbs to a summit of 9,180 ft. above sea level. At night the mouth of the canyon is a dangerous area as large herds of deer move into the farmlands for feeding. The north end of the mountain range features a peak known as Farnsworth Peak which houses almost all Salt Lake City FM and TV station transmitters. The peak is also used for emergency communications (such as police, fire, and EMS). Several local businesses and amateur radio operators have transmitters on Farnsworth Peak."

6,35,"The CVH (Compound Valve angle Hemispherical combustion chamber) engine was introduced by Ford in 1980 in the third generation European Ford Escort and for the 1981 North American Escort. It was later used in the Ford Sierra as well as the second generation Ford Fiesta and from 1983 it was used in the Ford Orion. Engines were built in the Dearborn Engine Plant for the North American market, and in Ford's then-new engine plant in Bridgend in Wales for the European market. The engine was originally conceived in 1974 and had a single overhead cam. Its valves were mounted at a compound angle in hemispherical combustion chambers, although some versions altered the combustion chamber shape to increase swirl. It also featured hydraulic valve lifters, a first for a European Ford engine. The engine was given different names throughout its production. From 1991 to 1996 in the Ford Escort, it was \""1.9L SEFI\""; and from 1997 to 2002, it was \""Split Port Induction 2000\"". From 2000 to 2004 in the Ford Focus, it was \""Split Port\"". Despite its considerable shortcomings in terms of Noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) and its intolerance of poor or neglected servicing, the CVH was regarded as being a very easy engine to tune, with many of its key components being considerably over-engineered. It wasn't long before the engine started receiving attention from the aftermarket tuning industry, and the 1.6 L version quickly became a stalwart of the tuning scene in the 1980s and 1990s with some significant increases in power output (over 200 bhp (150 kW)) being extracted from the turbocharged variants. The naturally aspirated 1.6 L was a popular choice for the kit car industry, where it could be relatively easily and cheaply tweaked to around 130 bhp (97 kW). The CVH was produced in many different capacities from 1.1 to 2.0 L, the smaller versions being exclusively for the European market."

Bred by John Harper at his farm near Midway, Kentucky, Ten Broeck was sired by United Kingdom import Phaeton, a son of Baron Mayer de Rothschild's stallion King Tom. Ten Broeck's dam was Fannie Holton. On John Harper's death, the horse became the property of his nephew, Frank B. Harper. Ten Broeck raced once at age two, finishing third in a race for two-year-old colts at Lexington, Kentucky. In 1875, the three-year-old Ten Broeck defeated Aristides to win the Phoenix Hotel Stakes. In May's Kentucky Derby, he moved into second place by the three-quarters of a mile pole but faded to finish fifth behind winner Aristides. Overall, that year Ten Broeck won five of his nine starts and continued to improve at age four, taking seven of eight races while setting a new World record time for a four-mile race on dirt. At age five, of his ten starts he won nine and finished second once. That only defeat came to Pierre Lorillard IV's future Hall of Fame colt, Parole, in the Baltimore Special. With sixteen wins and two seconds in eighteen starts during his last two racing seasons, Ten Broeck was brought back to race twice more in 1878 and won both times. Ridden by Billy Walker, he won a much-talked-about match race victory over the Californian star Mollie McCarty. The story of this race is recounted in the lyrics of the Kentucky folk song Molly and Tenbrooks. Retired to stud duty, Ten Broeck met with modest success. He sired 1885 Travers Stakes winner Bersan, and the 1884 and 1886 Tennessee Derby winners Ten Strike and Jim Gray. He was also the sire of the filly Ten Penny, who won the 1888 Kentucky Oaks, and Tolu, winner of the 1884 Alabama Stakes. He is the grandsire of 1904 Kentucky Derby winner Elwood. Ten Broeck died in 1887 (the same year the great Kincsem of Hungary died) and is buried at Nantura Stock Farm (the farm was named by its owner, Uncle John Harper, for the dam of Longfellow) in Midway, Kentucky. According to the National Sporting Library, his headstone was the first ever erected for a Thoroughbred in the state of Kentucky.

8,57,"The caciques are passerine birds in the New World blackbird family which are resident breeders in tropical South America north to Mexico. All of the group are in currently placed in the genus Cacicus, except the aberrant yellow-billed cacique (Amblycercus holosericeus), and the Mexican cacique (Cassiculus melanicterus) which constitute respective monotypic genera. Judging from mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence (Price & Lanyon 2002), the aberrant oropendolas band-tailed oropendola (Ocyalus latirostris) and casqued oropendola, Psarocolius oseryi (Ocyalus oseryi?) seem to be closer to the caciques. The caciques are birds associated with woodland or forest. Most are colonial breeders, with several long, hanging, bag-shaped nests in a tree, each suspended from the end of a branch. Some species choose a tree that also contains an active wasp nest (such as Polybia rejecta) as a deterrent to predators (e.g. toucans), and females compete for the best sites near the protection of the wasp nest. The eggs are incubated by the female alone. These are slim birds with long tails and a predominantly black plumage. The relatively long pointed bill is pale greenish, yellowish or bluish, depending on species, and most caciques have blue eyes (at least when adult). The female is typically smaller than the male. Two species have the black plumage enlivened by a red rump, five have a yellow rump and in some cases yellow on the shoulders or crissum (around the cloacal opening). The two remaining species are all black with no bright colour patches. A single species, the Mexican cacique, has extensive yellow to the tail, but otherwise all caciques have largely black tails (something that separates them from the larger oropendolas). Caciques eat large insects and fruit. Most are gregarious and typically seen in small groups. They are very vocal, producing a wide range of songs, sometimes including mimicry. Most remain fairly common and are able to withstand some habitat modifications, but two west Amazonian species, the Ecuadorian and Selva caciques, are notably local and scarce."

4,45,"Greatest Hits Redux is a compilation album that was released on the Cooking Vinyl label the same day as another Cracker greatest hits compilation called Get On With It: The Best of Cracker released by Virgin Records. The reason for this album release on the same day is that the band was unhappy with their former label Virgin Records not allowing them to participate in the compilation project they were preparing, so they retaliated by re-recording a selection of their signature tunes and releasing this new album on the same day. In a similar fashion, the Redux versions of the songs undercut the price of the originals on iTunes, resulting in greater sales for the Redux versions. Nine of the 13 songs that appear here are also on the Virgin compilation. Since these songs were re-recorded, there are some subtle differences scattered throughout such as changed lyrics or different instrument fills. Knowing this, a true fan could reasonably argue that this is in fact not a compilation, but a new studio recording, even though the songs had all been recorded and released prior to this album (except for \""Something You Ain't Got\"", which would appear a few months later in the year on their Greenland release)."

7,23,"Elliott Knob is one of the highest mountains in the northern portions of the U.S. state of Virginia. At 4,463 ft (1,360 m), the peak is located on the ridge known as Great North Mountain. A subpeak known simply as \""Hogback\"" (4,447 ft (1,355 m)) is located .50 mi (0.80 km) to the southwest. A small, naturally growing stand of red spruce trees are on the summit, and the upper slopes also have yellow birch and sugar maple, indicating that the altitude is just high enough to support tree species normally found hundreds of miles to the north. Otherwise oak and hickory trees are the most common types found on the mountain. The mountain is entirely within George Washington and Jefferson National Forests. The area around the mountain is inhabited by a wide array of fauna including black bears, white-tailed deer and the elusive bobcat. A primitive jeep trail ascends the mountain from the east but it is also closed to public vehicles. The jeep trail is used by the Forest Service to gain access to a (closed) fire lookout on the summit and is very steep, rising over 2,000 ft (610 m) in less than 2.5 mi (4.0 km). Just 4 mi (6.4 km) to the south of the mountain lies the town of Augusta Springs, Virginia, which is 2,800 ft (850 m) below the summit. The only access for the public is on foot and along with the jeep trail, several other trails can be used to ascend to the top, each averaging 5 mi (8.0 km) in length and climbing up to 2,400 ft (730 m) from the trailheads. A small grassy cove is on the top and there is a spring .40 mi (0.64 km) below the summit which flows year round as well as a small man made pond not far from the spring. Right beside the base of the fire tower there is a National Geodetic Survey triangulation station disk. The entire firetower structure is enclosed within a fence with barbed wire at the top. However, there is evidence of people gaining entry in the form of holes under the fence and loose sections where the fence can be pulled up high enough for a person to crawl under, since the ground is only covered with grass in that area of the summit."

The first church known by the name of 'Wooden Church' was built in 1724 and it stood until 1937. István Bató, a 19th-century citizen of Miskolc left a large sum to the church. As long as there are Protestants in Miskolc, this wooden church should be kept in good condition... should it burn down, it should be rebuilt of wood, he wrote in his will. Thus when the church became too old to maintain, the citizens decided that the new church should also be built of wood. The new church was designed by Bálint Szeghalmi. It was made entirely of wood brought from Transylvania, an area with long traditions of wood-carving, and the design also had Transylvanian elements. (Szeghalmi also designed the first permanent lookout tower on Avas hill in similar style.) The result was a beautiful and unique church. The construction was finished by 1938. The church was set on fire by an arsonist on December 4, 1997. The city mourned its loss, and an almost identical church was built in its place in 1999."

I-696 is a bypass route, detouring around the city of Detroit through the city's northern suburbs in Oakland and Macomb counties. It starts by branching off I-96 and I-275 at its western terminus in Novi, and runs through suburbs including Southfield, Royal Oak and Warren before merging into I-94 at St. Clair Shores on the east end. It has eight lanes for most of its length and is approximately 10 miles (16 km) north of downtown Detroit. I-696 connects to other freeways such as I-75 (Chrysler Freeway) and M-10 (Lodge Freeway). Local residents sometimes refer to I-696 as \""The Autobahn of Detroit.\"" Planning for the freeway started in the 1950s. Michigan state officials proposed the designation I-98, but this was not approved. Construction started on the first segment in 1961, and the Lodge Freeway was designated Business Spur Interstate 696 (BS I-696) the following year. The western third of the freeway opened in 1963, and the eastern third was completed in January 1979. The central segment was the subject of much controversy during the 1960s and 1970s. Various municipalities along this stretch argued over the routing of the freeway such that the governor locked several officials into a room overnight until they would agree to a routing. Later, various groups used federal environmental regulations to force changes to the freeway. The Orthodox Jewish community in Oak Park was concerned about pedestrian access across the freeway; I-696 was built with a set of parks on overpasses to accommodate their needs. The Detroit Zoo and the City of Detroit also fought components of the freeway design. These concessions delayed the completion of I-696 until December 15, 1989. Since completion, the speed limit was raised from 55 to 70 miles per hour (90 to 115 km/h). In addition, some interchanges were reconfigured in 2006."

4,18,"The Eastern Daily Press (EDP) is a regional newspaper covering Norfolk, and northern parts of Suffolk and eastern Cambridgeshire, and is published daily in Norwich, UK.

The Swakop River, along with its main tributary Khan, is one of the largest temporary water-bearing rivers in the dry western part of Namibia. It is 460 km long and has a 30,100 km ² large catchment area. In Swakopmund, it flows into the South Atlantic. The name comes from the Khoekhoe languages of the Nama and Damara Tsoa-xaub. Tsoa means ‘excrement opening’ or ‘anus‘ while xaub stands for the ‘contents of excrement.’ This name derives from the observation that the flow of large amounts of brownish sludge in the rain with it and discharges into the Atlantic Ocean. The area around the river mouth and the surrounding dunes are also known for rich bird life and some unusual plant species (like the Welwitschia) that use the regular fog drifting in from the sea to sustain themselves in the absence of other moisture. Groundwater levels in the area have also dropped about 0.3 m further due to the presence of two big dams built on the Swakop River. Notwithstanding the river’s irregular flow, some agriculture is undertaken in the Swakop River valley, thus the region is well known for its fresh produce, especially tomatoes, asparagus and olives.

4,11,"The Tosa Nikki (Tosa Diary) is a poetic diary written anonymously by the tenth-century Japanese poet Ki no Tsurayuki. The text details a 55-day journey in 935 returning to Kyoto from Tosa province, where Tsurayuki had been the provincial governor. The prose account of the journey is punctuated by Japanese poems, purported to have been composed on the spot by the characters. The Tosa Nikki is the first notable example of the Japanese diary as literature. Until its time, the word “diary” (nikki) denoted dry official records of government affairs, written by men in Chinese. By contrast, the Tosa is written in the Japanese language, using phonetic kana characters. Literate men of the period wrote in both kana and Chinese, but women typically were not taught the latter, being restricted to kana literature. By framing the diary in the point of view of a fictitious female narrator, Tsurayuki could avoid employing Chinese characters or citing Chinese poems, focusing instead on the aesthetics of the Japanese language and its poetry."

Most scholars regard the 42 years in 2 Chronicles 22:2 as a copyist's error for an original 22 years. The age of 22 is also found in some Greek and Syrian versions of 2 Chronicles 22:2. William F. Albright has dated his reign to 842 BC, while E. R. Thiele offers the date 841/840 BC. As explained in the Rehoboam article, Thiele's chronology for the first kings of Judah contained an internal inconsistency that placed Ahaziah's reign one year after his mother Athaliah usurped the throne. Later scholars corrected this by dating these kings one year earlier, so that Ahaziah's dates are taken as one year earlier than Thiele's in the present article."

4,53,"Super Mario 3D Land (スーパーマリオ3Dランド Sūpā Mario Surī Dī Rando) is a platform game in the Super Mario series developed by Nintendo EAD Tokyo, with development assistance from Brownie Brown, for the Nintendo 3DS. The game was the first in the series to be released for the system and was released worldwide in November 2011. It was revealed at Nintendo's Keynote Conference during the 2011 Game Developers Conference held in San Francisco. A sequel, titled Super Mario 3D World, was released for the Wii U in 2013. Super Mario 3D Land is unique from other games in the Mario series, as it combines elements from both traditional 2D Mario side-scrolling games and modern free-roaming 3D Mario games. It also introduces new elements into the series, including new power-ups and gameplay mechanics. The main story is similar to previous Super Mario titles, centering on Mario's efforts to rescue Princess Peach, who has been kidnapped by Bowser, utilizing the aid of the Tanooki Suit amongst other power-ups. The game consists of 96 distinct levels allotted among the 16 worlds. The game was released to critical acclaim, with gaming critics praising the amount of creativity and technical design presented within the game, though the utilization of 3D in the gameplay was met with a more polarizing reception. The game was a commercial success, and has sold 10.81 million copies worldwide as of June 30, 2016, making it the fourth best-selling game for the 3DS. It was also the first 3DS game to sell over 5 million copies. Nintendo re-released the game as a downloadable title via Nintendo eShop.

5,24,"Free jazz is an approach to jazz music that was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s as musicians attempted to alter, extend, or break down jazz convention, often by discarding fixed chord changes or tempos. Though the music of free jazz composers varied widely, a common feature was dissatisfaction with the limitations of bebop, hard bop, and modal jazz that had developed in the 1940s and 1950s. Often described as avant-garde, free jazz has also been described as an attempt to return jazz to its primitive, often religious, roots and emphasis on collective improvisation. As its name implies, free jazz cannot be defined more than loosely, as many musicians draw on free jazz concepts and idioms, and it was never completely distinct as a genre. Many free jazz musicians, notably Pharoah Sanders and John Coltrane, used harsh overblowing or other techniques to elicit unconventional sounds from their instruments, or played unusual instruments. Free jazz musicians created a progressive musical language which drew on earlier styles of jazz such as Dixieland jazz and African music. Typically this kind of music is played by small groups of musicians. The music often swings but without regular meter, and there are frequent accelerandi and ritardandi. Free jazz is strongly associated with the 1950s innovations of Ornette Coleman and Cecil Taylor and the later works of saxophonist John Coltrane. Other important pioneers include Charles Mingus, Eric Dolphy, Albert Ayler, Archie Shepp, Joe Maneri and Sun Ra. Coleman pioneered many techniques typical of free jazz, most notably his rejection of pre-written chord changes, believing instead that freely improvised melodic lines should serve as the basis for harmonic progression in his compositions. Some of bassist Charles Mingus's work was also important in establishing free jazz. Of particular note are his early Atlantic albums, such as The Clown, Tijuana Moods, and most notably Pithecanthropus Erectus, the title song of which contained one section that was freely improvised in a style unrelated to the song's melody or chordal structure. Although today \""free jazz\"" is the generally used term, many other terms were used to describe the loosely defined movement, including \""avant-garde\"", \""energy music\"" and \""The New Thing\"". During its early and mid-1960s heyday, much free jazz was released by established labels such as Prestige, Blue Note, and Impulse, as well as independents such as ESP Disk and BYG Actuel. Keith Johnson of AllMusic describes a \""Modern Creative\"" genre, in which \""musicians may incorporate free playing into structured modes -- or play just about anything.\"" Johnson includes John Zorn, Henry Kaiser, Eugene Chadbourne, Tim Berne, Bill Frisell, Steve Lacy, Cecil Taylor, Ornette Coleman, and Ray Anderson in this genre, which continues \""the tradition of the '50s to '60s free-jazz mode\""."

4,53,"Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag is a 2013 action-adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is the sixth major installment in the Assassin's Creed series. Its historical timeframe precedes that of Assassin's Creed III (2012), though its modern-day sequences succeed III's own. Black Flag was first released on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Nintendo Wii U in October 2013 and a month later on the PlayStation 4, Microsoft Windows, and Xbox One. The plot is set in a fictional history of real world events and follows the centuries-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight for peace with free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through control. The framing story is set in the 21st century and describes the player as an Abstergo agent. The main story is set in the 18th century Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy, and follows notorious pirate Edward Kenway, grandfather and father of Assassin's Creed III protagonists Ratonhnhaké:ton and Haytham Kenway respectively, who stumble upon the Assassin/Templar conflict. Unlike previous games, gameplay elements focus more on ship-based exploration of the seamless open world map, while also retaining the series' third-person land-based exploration, melee combat, and stealth system. Multiplayer also returns, albeit with only land-based modes and settings. The game spans across the Caribbean with the three main cities of Havana, Nassau and Kingston along with numerous islands, sunken ships, and forts. Players have the option to harpoon large sea animals and hunt land animals. For the first time in the series, naval exploration is a major part of an Assassin's Creed game, where Edward Kenway captains the Jackdaw, a brig he captures from a Spanish fleet. Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag was positively received upon release, and was one of the best selling games of 2013. It has sold more than 11 million copies to date. Critics praised the massive open world gameplay, numerous side-quests, graphics and improved naval combat. The light-hearted pirate theme and engaging story were well received by critics. The modern day story however, received a slightly more mixed response, while criticism fell on aspects of the historical story missions which were considered repetitive. The game received several awards and nominations, including winning the Spike VGX 2013 award for Best Action Adventure Game. It was followed by Assassin's Creed Unity and Assassin's Creed Rogue, set during the French Revolution and Seven Years' War respectively, with both released in November 2014."

8,57,"(\""Pallas's warbler\"" redirects here. For the grass warbler, see Pallas's grasshopper warbler.) The Pallas's leaf warbler or Pallas's warbler (Phylloscopus proregulus) is a leaf warbler that breeds in mountain forests from southern Siberia east to northern Mongolia and northeastern China. It is named for German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas, who first formally described it. It is strongly migratory, wintering mainly in southern China and adjacent areas of southeast Asia, although in recent decades increasing numbers have been found in Europe in autumn. Pallas's leaf warbler is one of the smallest Eurasian warblers, with a relatively large head and short tail. It has greenish upperparts and white underparts, a lemon-yellow rump, and yellow double wingbars, supercilia and central crown stripe. It is similar to several other Asian warblers, including some that were formerly considered to be its subspecies, although its distinctive vocalisations aid identification. The female builds a cup nest in a tree or bush, and incubates the four to six eggs, which hatch after 12–13 days. The chicks are fed mainly by the female and fledge when they are 12–14 days old; both parents then bring food for about a week. Pallas's leaf warbler is insectivorous, feeding on the adults, larvae and pupa of small insects and spiders. Birds forage in bushes and trees, picking items from leaves or catching prey in short flights or while hovering. The Pallas's leaf warbler has a large range, and its numbers are believed to be stable. It therefore is evaluated as of \""least concern\"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)."

3,4,"Schmuck v. United States, 489 U.S. 705 (1989), is a United States Supreme Court decision on criminal law and procedure. By a 5–4 margin it upheld the mail fraud conviction of an Illinois man and resolved a conflict among the appellate circuits over which test to use to determine if a defendant was entitled to a jury instruction allowing conviction on a lesser included charge. Justice Harry Blackmun wrote for the majority; Antonin Scalia for the dissent. The case had begun when Schmuck was prosecuted for having rolled back odometers for years on cars he sold to used-car dealers. He had been indicted for 12 counts of mail fraud, based on the vehicle title applications the dealers had then mailed to the state's Department of Transportation in order to resell the cars. Before his trial in the Western District of Wisconsin, he had been denied a motion to have the jury instructed that they could vote to convict him of tampering with the odometer, at the time a less serious offense, if they did not find him guilty of mail fraud. He raised the issue after his conviction with the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, as well as the applicability of the mail-fraud statute to the dealers' applications. A panel rejected the latter argument but agreed that the jury should have been allowed to consider the lesser charge, reversing the conviction and remanding the case for a new trial. The government appealed that decision to an en banc panel of the circuit, which restored the conviction, holding that the odometer tampering was not \""inherently related\"" to the mail fraud. Since other appellate circuits had preferred a different test for lesser included charges, Schmuck successfully petitioned the Supreme Court to hear the case. Blackmun ruled for the government on both questions. Since Schmuck had enjoyed a continuing relationship with the dealers he sold to, and the cars could not be resold to a retail customer without titles obtained using false information, the dealers' applications were an essential element of his crime and thus constituted mail fraud. On the second question, Blackmun said the court should have considered whether the elements of odometer tampering were a subset of the elements of the mail fraud, and since that was not the case Schmuck had been properly denied the instruction. Scalia's dissent focused exclusively on the mail fraud issue. Since Schmuck had already received his payment for the altered vehicles, it did not matter what happened afterwards, a holding he found more consistent with the Court's earlier rulings on the subject."

It was released worldwide on September 9, 2014, for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One consoles. Destiny marked Bungie's first new console franchise since the Halo series, and it is the first game in a ten-year agreement between Bungie and Activision. Set in a \""mythic science fiction\"" world, the game features a multiplayer \""shared-world\"" environment with elements of role-playing games.

In addition to normal story missions, PvE features three-player \""strikes\"" and six-player raids. A free roam patrol mode is also available for each planet and features public events. PvP features objective-based modes, as well as traditional deathmatch game modes. Players take on the role of a Guardian, defenders of Earth's last safe city as they wield a power called Light to protect the City from different alien races.

9,49,"The Conservative Party, officially the Conservative and Unionist Party, is a political party in the United Kingdom. It is currently the majority party in the House of Commons, having won 330 of the 650 seats in the 2015 general election. Between 2010 and 2015 it was the largest single party with 306 Members of Parliament and governed in coalition with the Liberal Democrats. It is the largest party in local government with 8,296 councillors. The Conservative Party was founded in 1834 from the Tory Party—giving rise to the Conservatives' colloquial name of Tories—and was one of two dominant parties in the 19th century, along with the Liberal Party. In the 1920s, the Liberal vote greatly diminished and the Labour Party became the Conservatives' main rivals. Conservative Prime Ministers led governments for 57 years of the 20th century, including Winston Churchill (1940–45, 1951–55) and Margaret Thatcher (1979–90). Thatcher's tenure led to wide-ranging economic liberalisation and saw the Conservatives become the most eurosceptic of the three major parties. The Conservative Party's domination of British politics throughout the 20th century has led to them being referred to as one of the most successful political parties in the Western world. The Conservatives are the joint-second largest British party in the European Parliament, with twenty MEPs, and sit with the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) parliamentary group. The party is a member of the Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists (AECR) Europarty and the International Democrat Union (IDU). The party is the second-largest in the Scottish Parliament and third-largest in the Welsh Assembly. The Conservatives were formerly allied to the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) in Northern Ireland but there is now a separate Northern Ireland Conservative party similar to the Welsh and Scottish Conservative parties. The party is also organised in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar."

9,13,"Christopher Michael Jones (born 24 June 1980 in Manchester) is an English rugby union rugby player. He plays as a lock or flanker for Yorkshire Carnegie in the RFU Championship. His rugby union career blossomed at Stockport Grammar School. He went on to take a Business Studies course at Sheffield Hallam University and was two years into it when Sale Sharks invited him to join them. He played for Cheshire at U18 and U20 level, then briefly with Fylde before joining Sale Sharks. He made a startling rise to the England Sevens squad, and was nominated for the 2003 PRA Young Player of the Year Award. He was part of the England A team that beat France A, Scotland A and Italy A in their 2003 Six Nations and also went on the unbeaten England tour to North America and Japan that year. He played for England in the uncapped match against the Barbarians at Twickenham in May 2003. His outstanding Line-out jumping has made him a constant threat to other Premiership teams, while a series of long range tries for Sale Sharks has underlined his athletic capabilities. The year 2004 marked another leap forward. He was called up to the senior team by then head coach Clive Woodward from the start of the Six Nations. He came off the bench against Italy for his debut cap and promptly scored a try. This earned him a starting position against Scotland as a flanker and again against Wales from where he continued to impress. He was selected for the 2004 Summer tour, starting against the All Blacks in Dunedin in the first Test. Sale Sharks director of rugby Kingsley Jones referred to him as 'the most hard done-by player in England' after he was hardly used during the 2005 Autumn test series. Jones went on to collect more caps on the 2006 Summer tour of Australia and 2007 Summer tour of South Africa. In the 2005–2006 season, Jones started the final as Sale Sharks won their first ever Premiership title. He was also voted Sale's player of the year in 2006 and again in 2008.

9,33,"Abraham \""Abe\"" Gibron (September 22, 1925 – September 23, 1997) was a professional American football player and coach. Gibron played 11 seasons as a guard in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and National Football League (NFL) in the 1940s and 1950s, mostly with the Cleveland Browns. He was then hired as an assistant coach for the NFL's Washington Redskins and Chicago Bears before becoming head coach of the Bears between 1972 and 1974. Gibron grew up in Indiana, where he was a standout athlete in high school. After graduating, he spent two years in the U.S. military during World War II, enrolling at Valparaiso University upon his discharge. He later transferred to Purdue University, where he played football for two years and was named an All-Big Ten Conference guard. Gibron's professional career began in 1949 with the Buffalo Bills of the AAFC. The league dissolved after that season, however, and he moved to the Browns in the NFL. While he was initially a substitute, Gibron developed into a strong lineman on Cleveland teams that won NFL championships in 1950, 1954 and 1955 behind an offensive attack that featured quarterback Otto Graham, end Dante Lavelli and tackle Lou Groza. He was named to the Pro Bowl, the NFL's all-star game, each year between 1952 and 1955. After short stints with the Philadelphia Eagles and the Bears, Gibron ended his playing career and got into coaching. He served first as a line coach for the Redskins for five years, and then in a similar role for the Bears beginning in 1965. He rose to become Bears' defensive coordinator in the early 1970s, and was named head coach in 1972, replacing Jim Dooley. Gibron's three years leading the Bears were unsuccessful, however. His teams posted a combined win–loss–tie record of 11–30–1 over three seasons. Gibron was fired in 1974, and spent the following year as coach of the Chicago Winds, a team in the short-lived World Football League. Gibron, who was known for his colorful personality and large size – he ballooned to more than 300 pounds as a coach – spent seven seasons as an assistant with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers before retiring from coaching. He stayed close to the game, however, by serving as a scout for the Seattle Seahawks in the late 1980s and as an advisor to the Buccaneers in the early 1990s. He died after suffering a series of strokes in 1997."

It grows at 1,600-4,900 m altitude. It represents the provincial tree of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (unofficial). It is a coniferous evergreen shrub (rarely a small tree) reaching 2-10 m tall (rarely 15 m), with flaky brown bark, and a prostrate to irregularly conical crown.

The cones are berry-like, globose to ovoid, 4-9 mm long and 4-6 mm diameter, glossy black, and contain one seed; they are mature in about 18 months. The male cones are 3-4 mm long, and shed their pollen in early spring. It is largely dioecious, with pollen and seed cones produced on separate plants, but occasionally monoecious.

Taylor is considered to be one of the best golfers of all time. He was also a significant golf course architect. Taylor was born in Devon. He was a member of the fabled Great Triumvirate of the sport in his day, along with Harry Vardon and James Braid, and he won The Open Championship five times. Born into a working-class family, and orphaned as a boy, he began work as a caddy and labourer at the Royal North Devon Golf Club (also known as Westward Ho!) at the age of eleven. He was employed as a caddie and houseboy by the Hutchinson family and was tasked to carry the bag of Horace Hutchinson. He became a professional golfer at 19, and was employed by Burnham & Berrow Golf Club, the Winchester (later Royal Winchester) Golf Club - while there winning in successive years the first two of his Open Championships - then the Royal Wimbledon Golf Club, before eventually moving to the Royal Mid-Surrey Golf Club from 1899 until his retirement in 1946. In 1901, Taylor was a co-founder and the first chairman of the British Professional Golfers' Association. This was the first association for professional golfers in the world. Bernard Darwin wrote that Taylor \""had turned a feckless company into a self-respecting and respected body of men\"". Taylor was a factor in the Open Championship from age 22 in 1893, until age 55, when he tied for 11th place in 1926. His five Open victories all took place before the First World War. Open Championship wins: \n*  1894 – Royal St George's \n*  1895 – St Andrews \n*  1900 – St Andrews \n*  1909 – Royal Cinque Ports \n*  1913 – Royal Liverpool GC, Hoylake Taylor captained the 1933 Great Britain Ryder Cup team to a win over the United States, and remains the only captain on either side never to have played in any of the matches.

He is attributed with being the inventor of the 'dogleg', although holes of that form had existed on many courses before Taylor began golf course design (for example No. 7 at Old Course at St Andrews and No. 4 at Prestwick Golf Club). He was made an honorary member of the R&A in 1949, and was president of Royal Birkdale, whose course he had designed, in 1957.

A capable soldier and administrator, he consolidated Muslim rule in the area and expanded the Caliphate's border to include most of Transoxiana. From 705 to ca. 710 he consolidated Muslim control over the native principalities of Tokharistan and conquered the principality of Bukhara, while in 710–712 he conquered Khwarizm and completed the conquest of Sogdiana with the capture of Samarkand. The latter opened the road to the Jaxartes valley, and during the last years of his life Qutayba led annual campaigns there, extending Muslim control up to the Ferghana Valley. To increase his strained manpower, Qutayba initiated the wide-scale levy of native Khurasani and Transoxianian soldiers who fought alongside the Arab Muslim troops. Following Walid's death, Qutayba, insecure of his position under the new regime, rebelled but failed to secure the support of his army, and was defeated and killed. Most of his conquests in Transoxiana were lost in the years after his death; only in the 740s was the Muslim position restored to the line reached by Qutayba, and only after the Battle of Talas in 751 did the region come solidly under Muslim control."

8,57,"The sparkling violetear (Colibri coruscans) is a species of hummingbird. It is widespread in highlands of northern and western South America, including a large part of the Andes (from Argentina and northwards), the Venezuelan Coastal Range and the Tepuis. It occurs in a wide range of semi-open habitats, even in gardens and parks within major cities such as Quito, and is often the commonest species of hummingbird in its range. The sparkling violetear is most abundant near coniferous or evergreen eucalyptus forests. It is highly vocal and territorial. The sparkling violetear is the largest violetear at 13 to 15 cm (5–6 in) long. Male birds weigh 7.7 to 8.5 grams (0.27 to 0.3 oz) while females weigh from ounces 6.7 to 7.5 grams (0.24 to 0.26 oz). This hummingbird resembles the lesser violetear, but that species generally prefers more humid habitats, is obviously smaller and lacks the distinct purple-blue chest-spot and chin of the sparkling violetear. According to  it has the smallest mean blood-air barrier thickness (0.183 µm) and the highest mass-specific respiratory surface area in birds (87 cm²/g). Sparkling violetears are solitary and aggressive. Birds declare their territory by singing. The birds sing much of the day, and (in different parts of their range) sub-groups develop their own calls. Breeding seasons vary by region. Birds in Venezuela mate from July through October. Birds find mates at leks, areas where groups of males try to attract a female to mate. After mating, the male was once believed to leave all nesting responsibilities to the female. However, according to reports, male sparkling violet-ears were seen twice caring for their young. The mother lays two eggs in a tiny, cup-shaped nest made of twigs and other plant material. Eggs hatch in 17 to 18 days. The young fledge in three weeks."

The Court was asked to determine whether the exchange of different participation interests in home mortgages by a savings and loan association was a \""disposition of property\"" under 26 U.S.C. § 1001 of the Internal Revenue Code (since this was the requirement for them to realize, and deduct, their losses on these mortgages). The Court determined that it was a \""disposition of property\"" by making the following three holdings: \n* Under § 1001(a), exchange of property gives rise to realization (a \""disposition of property\"") only if the exchanged properties are \""materially different.\"" \n* This concept of \""material difference\"" is not defined by an economic substitute test (whether various parties would consider their differences to be \""material\""); rather, two properties are materially different if their respective possessors enjoy legal entitlements that are different in kind or extent. \n* The S&L's 90% participation interest in its mortgages embodied legally distinct entitlements (and so was \""materially different\"" from) the 90% mortgage participation interest it received from the other savings associations. Even if mortgages are \""substantially identical\"" for purposes of Federal Home Loan Bank Board \""Memorandum R-49\"" on reporting losses, they can still exhibit \""material difference\"" for the purposes of finding a \""disposition of property.\"""

1,48,"The Battle of Iwo Jima (19 February – 26 March 1945) was a major battle in which the U.S. Marines landed on and eventually captured the island of Iwo Jima from the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II. The American invasion, designated Operation Detachment, had the goal of capturing the entire island, including the three Japanese-controlled airfields (including the South Field and the Central Field), to provide a staging area for attacks on the Japanese main islands. This five-week battle comprised some of the fiercest and bloodiest fighting of the War in the Pacific of World War II. After the heavy losses incurred in the battle, the strategic value of the island became controversial. It was useless to the U.S. Army as a staging base and useless to the U.S. Navy as a fleet base. However, Navy Seabees rebuilt the landing strips, which were used as emergency landing strips for USAAF B-29s. The Imperial Japanese Army positions on the island were heavily fortified, with a dense network of bunkers, hidden artillery positions, and 18 km (11 mi) of underground tunnels. The Americans on the ground were supported by extensive naval artillery and air supremacy over Iwo Jima from the beginning of the battle by U.S. Navy and Marine Corps aviators. Japanese combat deaths numbered three times the number of American deaths, although uniquely in the Pacific War, American total casualties (dead and wounded) exceeded those of the Japanese. Of the 21,000 Japanese soldiers on Iwo Jima at the beginning of the battle, only 216 were taken prisoner, some of whom were captured because they had been knocked unconscious or otherwise disabled. The majority of the remainder were killed in action, although it has been estimated that as many as 3,000 continued to resist within the various cave systems for many days afterwards, eventually succumbing to their injuries or surrendering weeks later. Despite the bloody fighting and severe casualties on both sides, the Japanese defeat was assured from the start. Overwhelming American superiority in arms and numbers as well as almost complete control of air power—coupled with the impossibility of Japanese retreat or reinforcement, along with sparse food and supplies—permitted no plausible circumstance in which the Americans could have lost the battle. The battle is remembered primarily by Joe Rosenthal's Associated Press photograph of the raising of the U.S. flag on top of the 169 m (554 ft) Mount Suribachi by five U.S. Marines and one U.S. Navy combat corpsman. The photograph (and a color film by Marine Staff Sgt. Bill Genaust) records the second flag-raising on the mountain, both of which took place on the fifth day of the 36-day battle. Rosenthal's photograph promptly became iconic—of that battle, of the Pacific War, and of the Marine Corps itself—and has been widely reproduced."

7,9,"Blackfriars Railway Bridge is a railway bridge crossing the River Thames in London, between Blackfriars Bridge and the Millennium Bridge. There have been two structures with the name. The first bridge was opened in 1864 and was designed by Joseph Cubitt for the London, Chatham and Dover Railway. Massive abutments at each end carried the railway's insignia, preserved and restored on the south side. Following the formation of the Southern Railway in 1924, inter-city and continental services were concentrated on Waterloo, and St Paul's Station became a local and suburban stop. For this reason, the use of the original bridge gradually declined. It eventually became too weak to support modern trains, and was therefore removed in 1985 – all that remains is a series of columns crossing the Thames and the southern abutment, which is a Grade II listed structure. The second bridge, built slightly further downstream (to the east), was originally called St Paul's Railway Bridge and opened in 1886. It was designed by John Wolfe-Barry and Henry Marc Brunel and is made of wrought iron. It was built by Lucas & Aird. When St Paul's railway station changed its name to Blackfriars in 1937 the bridge changed its name as well. At the southern end of the bridge was Blackfriars Bridge railway station which opened in 1864 before closing to passengers in 1885 following the opening of what is today the main Blackfriars station. Blackfriars Bridge railway station continued as a goods stop until 1964 when it was completely demolished, and much of it redeveloped into offices. As part of the Thameslink Programme, the platforms at Blackfriars station have been extended across the Thames and partially supported by the 1864 bridge piers. The project is designed by WILL ALSOP and built by Balfour Beatty. The work also includes the installation of a roof covered with photovoltiac solar panels. It is the largest of only three solar bridges in the world (the others being Kennedy Bridge in Bonn, Germany, and Kurilpa Bridge in Australia). Other green improvements include sun pipes and systems to collect rain water. \n* Looking southwards across Blackfriars railway bridge from platform 4 at Blackfriars railway station \n* Blackfriars Railway Bridge.

Drawn by Ken Reid, Ricky Rubberneck was a boy with a \""bendable bonce\"" (head), his skin like stretch rubber. At will, he could scrunge his face into anything. Several of the stories were set at Belmonte School, home to two other recurring characters - his friend Cyril, and the headmaster Mr. Snipe. The strip was retained when Jet merged with Buster later that year, the first merged issue dated 2 October 1971. The word scrunch had been slowly overtaken by scrunge. As the years went by, the name Ricky Rubberneck was dropped and the character was simply called Faceache. Also, his scrunges got more and more complex, with him able to appear identical to other people, and even scrunging his entire body into various (monstrous) shapes, rather than just his face. In one strip he turned himself into a dodo, tricking his teacher into believing that that bird was not extinct; in another, he became a grotesque mole-like creature, burrowing under a smoke chimney and causing it to collapse. Reid continued drawing Faceache until his death in early 1987. Frank McDiarmid took over from then on, until the strip ended in the issue dated 1 October 1988. An adult Faceache appears in the 2005 comic Albion, as one of a number of comic book characters who have been imprisoned by the British government. In Albion Faceache's real name is said to be \""Frederick\"". The term \""faceache\"" was commonly used in England from the 1950s onwards to mean \""miserable-looking person\""."

The pass is a saddle between the San Juan Mountains to the south and the Uncompahgre Plateau to the north and divides the Uncompahgre River watershed from the San Miguel River watershed and Ouray County from San Miguel County. The pass takes its name from Dallas Creek which drains the basin on the north side of Mount Sneffels into the Uncompahgre River. The divide's namesake is George M. Dallas, 11th Vice President of the United States. The summit is not marked at the top, so travelers over the road may not notice they have just traversed the divide.

8,57,"The brown shyshark or plain happy (Haploblepharus fuscus) is a species of catshark, part of the family Scyliorhinidae. It is endemic to the shallow, coastal waters of South Africa from west of Cape Agulhas to KwaZulu-Natal. This benthic species is usually found over sandy or rocky bottoms. Measuring up to 73 cm (29 in) long, the brown shyshark is stoutly built, with a broad, flattened head and rounded snout. Unlike other shysharks, the brown shyshark has a plain brown color, though some individuals have faint \""saddle\"" markings or light or dark spots. When threatened, this shark curls into a circle with its tail over its eyes, which is the origin of the name \""shyshark\"". It feeds on bony fishes and lobsters, and is oviparous with females laying pairs of egg capsules. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this harmless species as Vulnerable. It is of no commercial or recreational interest, but its limited distribution makes its entire population vulnerable to increases in fishing pressure or habitat degradation."

8,57,"The Iberian barbel (Luciobarbus comizo) is a ray-finned fish species in the family Cyprinidae. It is here placed in Luciobarbus following the IUCN, but that genus is very closely related to the other typical barbels and perhaps better considered a mere subgenus of Barbus. This large barbel can grow to over 50 cm (20 in) long. Natural hybrids of this barbel and the closely related L. bocagei are not uncommon in the middle Tagus river. The two species and their hybrids are hard to distinguish, but L. comizo has a longer and more narrow, and the last unbranched ray of the dorsal fin has a longer denticulated section but with more widely spaced denticles. In the first two traits the hybrids are intermediate between their parent species, in the latter they are closer to the Iberian Barbel. Also, the two species are distinguished by their microhabitat preferences where they are sympatric, with L. bocagei inhabiting somewhat faster-moving parts of the river. The hybridisation confounds phylogenetic studies based only on mtDNA. L. comizo is endemic to the Iberian Peninsula, where it occurs in both Portugal and Spain. It inhabits the slow-moving middle and lower parts of rivers and reservoirs in the Tagus' and the Guadiana Rivers' drainage basins. Its habitat are deep and almost stagnant waters with abundant aquatic vegetation Its numbers have declined by about one-third since the 1990s due to unsustainable water usage for agriculture, pollution and competition with introduced species. Whether hybridisation with the more numerous L. bocagei also affects its numbers is not known. The two must have achieved reproductive isolation in the past to become as disting as they are, but damming and other construction have in recent times shifted the river's currents and changed microhabitat, so that these barbels will now meet at spawning sites more often. Altogether however, damming will slow the river's flow to almost a standstill, creating conditions more favourable to the Iberian Barbel than to L. bocagei, and the hybridisation may actually be a sign of the rarer species becoming more plentiful. In any case, the unsustainable extraction of for agriculture is the main threat of L. comizo. It is by no means as common as it was in past times, and classified as a Vulnerable by the IUCN. It is listed in Annex II of the European Union's Habitats Directive as a Species Requiring Designation of Special Conservation Areas, and in Annex V to allow for legal restrictions to its taking. It is also named as Protected Species in Appendix III of the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats."

1,48,"The 2007 Belgian federal election took place on Sunday 10 June 2007. Voters went to the polls in order to elect new members for the Chamber of Representatives and Senate. Eligible voters were Belgian citizens 18 years and older. There was a legal electoral threshold of 5% for political parties to meet to receive representation, but in several election districts the real electoral threshold is higher than the legal, due to the small number of seats to be elected in the particular district. The 150 members of the Chamber of Representatives were elected from 11 electoral districts. The 40 Senate members were elected from the Dutch (25) and Francophone (15) electoral colleges. Of the Flemish parties, the alliance of Christian Democratic and Flemish party (CD&V) and the New-Flemish Alliance (N-VA) received an increased share of the vote from the previous election, held in 2003. The CD&V/N-VA list was headed by Yves Leterme, and became the largest political formation in Belgium, thus leading the coalition talks for a new government. Flemish Interest (Vlaams Belang) received more votes than in the previous election, but lost one seat. Green! was able to return to parliament and newcomers List Dedecker (Lijst Dedecker) surprised most by immediately grabbing six seats, including one in the Senate. Prime minister Guy Verhofstadt's \""purple coalition,\"" consisting of his Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats (Open VLD) alliance list and Socialist Party – Different (SP.A/SPIRIT), was punished in the election, with the SP.A/SPIRIT alliance losing somewhat more than Verhofstadt's Open VLD alliance. The day after the election, Verhofstadt handed in the resignation of his government to King Albert II. SP.A leader Johan Vande Lanotte resigned from his leadership position as well that day. The Francophone situation did not mirror its Flemish counterpart. While Verhofstadt's Open VLD struggled, its Francophone sister party Mouvement Réformateur managed to defeat the long-dominant Parti Socialiste (PS), although the PS remained strong in Hainaut and Liège. The Humanist Democratic Centre brought in a positive result as well, but the biggest gains were for the environmentalist party Ecolo. The overall outcome of the elections was that the liberal fraction (MR, VLD) became the largest group in parliament with, followed by the Christian Democrats (CD&V, Cdh) and N-VA with 40 seats. The electoral alliance between the Flemish CD&V and N-VA parties became the biggest single parliamentary grouping (25 seats for CD&V and 5 for N-VA)."

9,49,"The Movement for Change in Turkey, or TDH (Turkish: Türkiye Değişim Hareketi), is a Turkish political movement founded in 2009 under the leadership of Mustafa Sarıgül. It was formerly in the process of organizing as a political party. After a period in the DSP, Sarıgül established the TDH in order to challenge the domination of the Turkish centre-left by the CHP, whose leader Deniz Baykal had withstood a leadership challenge by Sarıgül in 2005. The movement describes itself as social democratic and lists among its policy goals reducing Turkey's rich/poor gap, promoting pluralism, and empowering women and youth. The movement also emphasizes democratizing the country's political system and moving forward reforms to bring the country in line with EU norms. Opinion polls gave the TDH from 13% to 16% of the support of the electorate. The TDH attracted the support of CHP veterans Hikmet Çetin and Onur Kumbaracıbaşı, both former deputy prime ministers, and former ambassador Faruk Loğoğlu. It reportedly has as many as 670,000 volunteers. Journalists speculated that the TDH could mobilize female and younger voters, reconnect with the CHP's erstwhile supporters in the Alevi and Kurdish communities and, by toning down the CHP's strident secularism, cut into the base of the ruling conservative AK Party. In May 2010, rivalry between the CHP and TDH intensified as the CHP's Önder Sav accused Sarıgül of involvement in the publication of the video on YouTube that prompted Deniz Baykal's resignation as CHP leader, and also accused him of paying a hitman to try to kill Baykal. Sarıgül denied both allegations and has promised to seek legal redress against Sav. Following Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu's succession to CHP's leadership in 2010, Sarıgül announced that this created an opportunity for change in the CHP, and that he would not form a new party. The announcement took other leaders of the TDH by surprise."

9,47,"Duke Wartislaw X of Pomerania (1435 – 17 December 1478) was the second son of Duke Wartislaw IX of Pomerania and his wife, Sophia of Saxe-Lauenburg. He married twice. On 5 March 1454, he married Elizabeth of Brandenburg, the widow of the Duke Joachim II \""the Younger\"" of Pomerania-Stettin and daughter of Margrave John of the Neumark. She died in early 1465. They had two sons: Swantibor V and Ertmar, both died of the plague in 1464 at an early age. His second wife was Magdalena of Mecklenburg, the daughter of Henry, Duke of Mecklenburg-Stargard. This marriage was childless. After Wartislaw's death, Magdalena married Count Burkhard of Barby-Mühlingen. In 1458, his father died and he and his older brother, Eric II began jointly ruling Pomerania. They quickly got into a dispute over the inheritance and succession of Pomerania-Stolp and Pomerania-Rügenwalde. Eric had married princess Sophia, the daughter of Duke Bogislaw IX and after the death in 1459 of Eric of Pomerania, the last duke of Further Pomerania, wanted to rule Further Pomerania alone. Wartislaw wanted to rule Further Pomerania jointly, while Elector Frederick II of Brandenburg claimed Further Pomerania on behalf of his ward, the minor Otto III of Pomerania-Stettin. In 1464, Otto III died of the plague. With his death, the Pomerania-Stettin line of the House of Griffins died out. Frederick II then claimed that Pomerania-Stettin was a completed fief of Brandenburg, and that it should fall back to Brandenburg, while Eric II and Wartislaw X held that Pomerania-Stettin should fall to the surviving line of the House of Griffins. This led to a conflict known as the Stettin War of Succession. Wartislaw X showed himself as an implacable opponent of the Hohenzollerns. His first wife, Elisabeth, who was herself a Hohenzollern, left him and this was used as ammunition by the Hohenzollerns in their propaganda war against the Pomeranian dukes. Due to Wartislaw's intransigence, a compromise with the Hohenzollerns was only possible after his death. In 1479, his nephew Bogislaw X, Duke of Pomerania, negotiated the Peace of Prenzlau. This treaty confirmed an agreement from 1472, that Wartislaw had approved. The key points were that the Dukes in Wolgast were allowed to keep Pomerania-Stettin, but had to accept that they were vassals of Brandenburg and held Pomerania as a fief. Wartislaw' opposition had been directed mainly against this last provision. After Wartislaw's death, Bogislaw X reunited all part of Pomerania and ruled the Duchy for almost fifty years. In the end, he also successfully challenged the status of Pomerania as a fief of Brandenburg. The issue was finally settled by Bogislaw's sons George I and Barnim XI in the Treaty of Grimnitz of 1529. Wartislaw X died in 1478 and was buried in the monastery at Neuenkamp, which later evolved into the city of Franzburg."
